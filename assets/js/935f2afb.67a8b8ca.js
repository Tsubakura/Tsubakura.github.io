The tankbuster will first deal four small strikes which inflicts a stack of vulnerability debuff each.

This attack is an exaflare, proximity explosion and a spread attack combined in one. In order to resolve this mechanic, the party first needs to run to the edge where the exaflares are starting in order to minimize the damage from the proximity explosions. The party then needs to spread out immediately in order to not hit each other with the targeted AoE. Once the spread has been resolved, each player dodges the exaflare that is coming from the other side.","sidebar":"mySideBar"},"savage/pandaemonium/p1s/p1s":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p1s/p1s","title":"P1S - Erichthonios","description":"Coming soon..."},"savage/pandaemonium/p2s/p2s":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p2s/p2s","title":"P2S - Hippokampos","description":"Coming soon..."},"savage/pandaemonium/p3s/p3s":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p3s/p3s","title":"P3S - Phoinix","description":"Coming soon..."},"savage/pandaemonium/p4s/p4s":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p4s/p4s","title":"P4S - Hesperos","description":"Coming soon..."},"savage/pandaemonium/p5s/p5s":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p5s/p5s","title":"P5S - Proto-Carbuncle","description":"Coming soon..."},"savage/pandaemonium/p6s/p6s":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p6s/p6s","title":"P6S - Hegemone","description":"Coming soon..."},"savage/pandaemonium/p7s/p7s":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p7s/p7s","title":"P7S - Agdistis","description":"Coming soon..."},"savage/pandaemonium/p8s/p8s":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p8s/p8s","title":"P8S - Hephaistos","description":"Coming soon..."},"savage/pandaemonium/p9s/p9s":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p9s/p9s","title":"P9S - Kokytos","description":"Coming soon...","sidebar":"mySideBar"},"ultimates/fru/fru_intro":{"id":"ultimates/fru/fru_intro","title":"FRU Intro","description":"Majority of the PFs follows this specific pastebin//pastebin.com/4UtwvXQu","sidebar":"mySideBar"},"ultimates/fru/phase_1/fall_of_faith":{"id":"ultimates/fru/phase_1/fall_of_faith","title":"Fall of Faith","description":"WIP","sidebar":"mySideBar"},"ultimates/fru/phase_1/utopian_sky":{"id":"ultimates/fru/phase_1/utopian_sky","title":"Utopian Sky","description":"WIP","sidebar":"mySideBar"},"ultimates/fru/phase_2/diamond_dust":{"id":"ultimates/fru/phase_2/diamond_dust","title":"Diamond Dust","description":"WIP","sidebar":"mySideBar"},"ultimates/fru/phase_2/endless_ice_age":{"id":"ultimates/fru/phase_2/endless_ice_age","title":"Endless Ice Age","description":"WIP","sidebar":"mySideBar"},"ultimates/fru/phase_2/light_rampant":{"id":"ultimates/fru/phase_2/light_rampant","title":"Light Rampant","description":"WIP","sidebar":"mySideBar"},"ultimates/fru/phase_2/mirror_mirror":{"id":"ultimates/fru/phase_2/mirror_mirror","title":"Mirror, Mirror","description":"WIP","sidebar":"mySideBar"},"ultimates/fru/phase_3/apocalypse":{"id":"ultimates/fru/phase_3/apocalypse","title":"Apocalypse","description":"While the MT is busy taking the Black Halo, use this opportunity for the supports and DPS to preposition themselves at west and east respectively.
