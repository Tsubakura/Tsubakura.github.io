After the initial four strikes, the 5th strike will be the actual tankbuster that deals a high amount of damage that is fatal to anyone that isn\'t a tank. The vulnerability debuff stacks can be cleansed with either Esuna (healers) or The Warden\'s Paean (BRD). If the vulnerabilities are not cleansed in time, then the resulting tankbuster will be fatal to the tanks.","sidebar":"mySideBar"},"savage/pandaemonium/p12s/p12s_p2_caloric_2":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p12s/p12s_p2_caloric_2","title":"P12S - Caloric Theory 2","description":"Athena will start casting Caloric Theory again to signal the start of Caloric Theory 2. One random player will get a red marker, while the rest get a green marker. Once Athena is done casting, an aero circle will go off on all players with a green marker. Just like Caloric 1, hitting someone else with this attack is fatal because of Close Caloric, so make sure that everyone spreads out in a formation to avoid clipping each other.","sidebar":"mySideBar"},"savage/pandaemonium/p12s/p12s_p2_classical_1":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p12s/p12s_p2_classical_1","title":"P12S - The Classical Concepts 1","description":"Athena will start this mechanic off by immediately casting The Classical Concepts. This mechanic will generate a 3x4 grid of orbs over the arena while simultaneously inflicting debuffs that splits the party in pairs. Your partner can be easily identified by the same playstation marker and the green tether that appears shortly after.","sidebar":"mySideBar"},"savage/pandaemonium/p12s/p12s_p2_classical_2":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p12s/p12s_p2_classical_2","title":"P12S - The Classical Concepts 2","description":"Athena will cast The Classical Concepts again, which will again summon a 3x4 grid of orbs on the field. However, this version of Classical Concept comes with a twist compared to how the first one works. During this mechanic, Athena will cast Panta Rhei, which will flip the whole orb grid by 180 degrees. Another difference compared to the first Classical Concept, is that Athena will now cast Palladian Ray before the orbs explode. This will limit the available space for the ray baits, because the players need to be able to dodge the exploding orbs after the bait.","sidebar":"mySideBar"},"savage/pandaemonium/p12s/p12s_p2_gaiaochos_1":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p12s/p12s_p2_gaiaochos_1","title":"P12S - Gaiaochos 1","description":"Athena will start the battle by casting Ultima, which is a generic raidwide attack.

This attack is an exaflare, proximity explosion and a spread attack combined in one. In order to resolve this mechanic, the party first needs to run to the edge where the exaflares are starting in order to minimize the damage from the proximity explosions. The party then needs to spread out immediately in order to not hit each other with the targeted AoE. Once the spread has been resolved, each player dodges the exaflare that is coming from the other side.","sidebar":"mySideBar"},"savage/pandaemonium/p1s/p1s":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p1s/p1s","title":"P1S - Erichthonios","description":"Coming soon..."},"savage/pandaemonium/p2s/p2s":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p2s/p2s","title":"P2S - Hippokampos","description":"Coming soon..."},"savage/pandaemonium/p3s/p3s":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p3s/p3s","title":"P3S - Phoinix","description":"Coming soon..."},"savage/pandaemonium/p4s/p4s":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p4s/p4s","title":"P4S - Hesperos","description":"Coming soon..."},"savage/pandaemonium/p5s/p5s":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p5s/p5s","title":"P5S - Proto-Carbuncle","description":"Coming soon..."},"savage/pandaemonium/p6s/p6s":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p6s/p6s","title":"P6S - Hegemone","description":"Coming soon..."},"savage/pandaemonium/p7s/p7s":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p7s/p7s","title":"P7S - Agdistis","description":"Coming soon..."},"savage/pandaemonium/p8s/p8s":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p8s/p8s","title":"P8S - Hephaistos","description":"Coming soon..."},"savage/pandaemonium/p9s/p9s":{"id":"savage/pandaemonium/p9s/p9s","title":"P9S - Kokytos","description":"Coming soon...","sidebar":"mySideBar"}}}')}}]);
