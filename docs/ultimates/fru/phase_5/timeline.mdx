Pandora will auto attack two players with the highest aggro, so make absolutely sure that both tanks have their stance on. The MT should immediately provoke as soon as possible to establish the highest enmity in preparation for <strong>Paradise Regained</strong>.

Unlike the other phases, the final phase features two loops where the mechanics are repeated in the following order:

1. <Raidwide>Fulgent Blade</Raidwide>
2. Paradise Regained
3. Polarizing Strikes
4. <Raidwide>Pandora's Box</Raidwide>
5. <Raidwide>Fulgent Blade</Raidwide>
6. Paradise Regained
7. Polarizing Strikes
8. <Raidwide>Fulgent Blade</Raidwide>
9. <Enrage>Paradise Lost</Enrage>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Fulgent Blade</th>
        <td>A raidwide attack which spawns multiple exalines that needs to be dodged, which is then followed by an <strong>Akh Morn</strong> at the end. Both <Raidwide>Fulgent Blade</Raidwide> and <strong>Akh Morn</strong> require at least 3x10% or 2x10% + shield on full hp in order to survive.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Paradise Regained</th>
        <td>Tankbusters and towers. The tankbusters are roughly 450k damage per hit and each tank gets tankbustered twice in quick succession. Discuss amongst your party which tank is going to use their invulnerability first. The tank who is not using their invulnerability must use all their mitigations. This tank must also be helped by the healers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Polarizing Strikes</th>
        <td>Four sets of line stack AoEs that deal roughly 110k damage per strike. Essentially a heal check that becomes dangerous when not mitigated properly.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Pandora's Box</th>
        <td>A raidwide that deals as high as 800k damage. A tank LB3 and at least 1 mitigation (shield is okay) is required to survive this attack. If LB3 is not available for whatever reason, then the party needs at least 80% worth of mitigations in order to survive this attack. Surviving without LB3 is not possible if the party does not have jobs that has extra mitigations.<br /><br />The tanks can press LB3 once they see the message "Transcend your limits to survive!" appear on their screen.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Paradise Lost</th>
        <td>Enrage. The window to use the melee LB3 is very short, so prioritize using it as soon as possible when available.</td>
    </tr>
