Three towers will spawn around the arena in a triangle formation, with the towers spawning one at a time after a set interval. At the same time, Pandora will fire two sets of two tankbusters simultaneously, which should be taken by the tanks. All towers must be soaked by two players each, all while making sure that the tankbusters does not end up on your non-tank party members.

This is by far the hardest mechanic that tanks have to deal with, but pretty easy otherwise for non-tanks.

## Wings Dark and Light explained
Pandora attacks the party with two sets of two tankbusters at the same time, signaled by her casting <Tankbuster>Wings Dark and Light</Tankbuster>:
1. A half-moon cleave that targets the player with the highest aggro, inflicting a physical vulnerability. 
2. A small AoE tankbuster that targets either the furthest or the closest player that does not have the main aggro, inflicting a magical vulnerability in the process.

The properties of the tankbusters changes depending on whether the element is light or dark. You can check below how the two tankbusters behaves depending on which element you're dealing with.

Keep in mind that the images above are purely an illustration of how the moon-cleave works and does not reflect what the PF does. The actual PF strategy involves aiming the cleave north to south, which allows non-tanks to soak their towers without having to think about whether its dark or light first.

This is good news for non-tanks as this effectively turns it into a braindead strategy for them. Unfortunately though for the tanks, this mechanic is absolutely not free and precision is required.

## Paradise Regained - North South strategy
The first tower will spawn once Pandora finishes casting <strong>Paradise Regained</strong>. Immediately preposition yourself around this first tower, because this tower is now the new south. This new south is important, because tower 2 and 3 will always spawn northwest and northeast relative to the first tower.

Once Pandora starts casting <Tankbuster>Wings Dark and Light</Tankbuster>, the tanks need to immediately identify which of her wings are glowing first. The element alternates, so in case the first set is light, the second set will always be dark, and vice versa.

Some things to keep in mind that will help...
- Light is Right, Dark is Left!
- Notice the red lines in the above diagrams? These are reference points which the tanks can use to aim their half-moon cleaves.
- Greeding is not recommended, it is not worth wiping your party over it.
- Plan your mitigation timings accordingly, you can use Rampart and your heavy mitigation as early as when the first tower appears.
  - Using mitigations early will help ease the burden on your mind while trying to determine whether it is light or dark first.
  - The tankbusters hit hard, so healers must help whoever is not using their invulnerability.
- As ST, do not forget to provoke while Pandora is still casting <Tankbuster>Wings Dark and Light</Tankbuster>.
- As with all the other mechanics throughout this fight, the snapshot happens when the castbar of <Tankbuster>Wings Dark and Light</Tankbuster> disappears. As non-tanks, that is your cue to start running towards north.
- Use your sprint! You can use it once Pandora finishes casting <strong>Paradise Regained</strong>.
- A part of the towers at the northern side will always be cleaved, make sure to edge the northern side as much as you can to account for possible error from the tanks.
