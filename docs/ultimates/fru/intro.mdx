Majority of the PFs follows this specific pastebin: https://pastebin.com/4UtwvXQu
- There are some minor differences in the DPS priority, double check with your party whether it is D1234, D3412 or D3124.

Changes are to be expected soon, but should likely be minimal and have no bearing in understanding how the mechanics work.

## Phases
- Phase 1 - Fatebreaker
- Phase 2 - Usurper of Frost
- Phase 3 - Oracle of Darkness
- Phase 4 - Gaia and Shiva
- Phase 5 - Pandora


## Setup

There are currently multiple waymarks going around, which will affect Crystallize Time and Fulgent Blade.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="OCE" label="OCE" default>

## OCE waymarks
Waymarks from Materia DC. This is my personal favorite.

```json
{"Name":"FRU OCE","MapID":1006,"A":{"X":100.012,"Y":0.0,"Z":91.275,"ID":0,"Active":true},"B":{"X":108.293,"Y":0.0,"Z":100.026,"ID":1,"Active":true},"C":{"X":99.964,"Y":0.0,"Z":108.349,"ID":2,"Active":true},"D":{"X":91.969,"Y":0.0,"Z":99.987,"ID":3,"Active":true},"One":{"X":90.977,"Y":0.0,"Z":90.679,"ID":4,"Active":true},"Two":{"X":109.154,"Y":0.0,"Z":90.916,"ID":5,"Active":true},"Three":{"X":109.042,"Y":0.0,"Z":108.973,"ID":6,"Active":true},"Four":{"X":90.987,"Y":0.0,"Z":108.899,"ID":7,"Active":true}}
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Outer" label="Outer" default>

## Inner waymarks
Inner waymarks, used to determine where you have to stand in Crystallize Time in order to not fly into the wall during the rewind. This is the one used by Tuufless.

```json
{"Name":"FRU Tuufless","MapID":1006,"A":{"X":100.0,"Y":0.0,"Z":90.0,"ID":0,"Active":true},"B":{"X":110.0,"Y":0.0,"Z":100.0,"ID":1,"Active":true},"C":{"X":100.0,"Y":0.0,"Z":110.0,"ID":2,"Active":true},"D":{"X":90.0,"Y":0.0,"Z":100.0,"ID":3,"Active":true},"One":{"X":92.929,"Y":0.0,"Z":92.929,"ID":4,"Active":true},"Two":{"X":107.071,"Y":0.0,"Z":92.929,"ID":5,"Active":true},"Three":{"X":107.071,"Y":0.0,"Z":107.071,"ID":6,"Active":true},"Four":{"X":92.929,"Y":0.0,"Z":107.071,"ID":7,"Active":true}}
