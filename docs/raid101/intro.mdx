So, you want to start raiding? Maybe you are already raiding, but you have no idea what you were getting yourself into. Or maybe, you've already been yelled at by people and have experienced firsthand terror as to how scary PF sometimes can be. Well, look no further as this section will try to break down raiding and its culture into steps, so that people might be eased into raiding instead of having to deal with everything at the same time.

The content of these articles will be written with the use of my own raiding experience as a basis, my own research and with my thoughts as to what would help a new player. Do be critical when reading through the articles as I can always use feedback, but also remember that everyone learns differently and at a different speed.

The articles in raiding 101 will be further expanded as time passes and whenever I get the inspiration to write a new article.
