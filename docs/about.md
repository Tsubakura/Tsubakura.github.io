## About this website
Unlike all the other million guides which specifically talks about strategies which players can use to clear, this website focuses more on teaching concepts instead of teaching people strategies. There is nothing wrong with guides that focuses specifically on strategies, but unfortunately, this also cultivates people who can only imitate what is seen on a guide while having no knowledge about actual raiding. More often than not, this player will cause a wipe in a raid and the person would be none the wiser as to why the wipe happened.

Let me repeat again that there is nothing wrong with wanting to just clear content, but my goal here is to make people become better raiders by teaching players conceptual insight to the mechanics. Thus, if you're someone who only cares about the strategies, then this website might not be for you. Naturally, strategies will be discussed, but understanding the mechanics comes first.

The scope of this website expands to NA Aether, JP Elemental and JP Mana. As not everyone raids on multiple datacenters, not everything that is written will be applicable to everyone.
