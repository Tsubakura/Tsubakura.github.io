Upon entering the stage, you will be in an area with four enemies, two of them accompanied with trash mobs, that you need to defeat in order to reach the first boss. Each of those big enemies are essentially as strong as a miniboss, so pick them off one by one in order to avoid being prematurely wiped by their strong attacks.

It is recommended to pick off the Aqueduct Belladonna first, as the plant is immediately in front of you once you enter the area. Otherwise, you can pick off the Aqueduct Kaluk first instead if the plant has wandered out of your range.

## Aqueduct Belladonna

This plant has three attacks that is used in the following order:
- **Atropine Spore**: A donut attack with the boss as center.
- <Tankbuster>Deracinator</Tankbuster>: A tankbuster on the player with the highest aggro. This is usually invulned by the tank.
- **Frond Affront**: A gaze attack, which can be dodged by looking away. You will usually defeat this enemy before it can get this cast off.

Drag the plant to the entrance of the area in order to avoid accidentally baiting the walking tree that is patrolling the area. After that, you can start pummeling the mob down until it is defeated. Although the tankbuster might look like an AoE due to its animation, you can actually safely stand together with the tank while he/she is receiving the tankbuster.

## Aqueduct Kaluk

This tree has two attacks which it constantly alternates:
- **Left/Right Sweep**: The boss cleaves either left or right from where its facing. Be careful of the front side, as the cleave is not perfectly half.
- **Creeping Ivy**: Faces a random party member to inflict a 90 degrees conal AoE, which can be dodged.

As the tank, make sure to face the mob away from the party. Now, dodge left or right depending on which way the tree is sweeping. When you see the mob facing you, immediately dodge sideways to dodge the conal attack.

Once the tree has been defeated, you can now choose to either engage the Udumbara at the west or the Dryad at the east. The Udambara is more annoying to deal with, so it is recommended to engage that one first.

## Aqueduct Udumbara and Aqueduct Sapria

The Udumbara is a giant three headed lizard-like plant that is accompanied by two Aqueduct Sapria. The Saprias are considered trash mobs and are only capable of doing one attack, which is a large telegraphed conal AoE. The Udumbara however, is more dangerous as it can do either front conal or diagonal halfroom cleaves, depending on which direction the plant is attacking.

    </tr>

Face the mobs away from the party and make sure that there is plenty of space around the three-headed plant for the party to dodge the attacks.


## Aqueduct Dryad and Aqueduct Odqan

Finally, we have the Dryad and the Odqans. The mobs will occasionally use either <strong>Acorn Bomb</strong> or <strong>Uproot</strong> to target a random player with an AoE puddle, which can easily be dodged by moving out of the puddle. The Dryad itself however, has its own untelegraphed chariot move. Once you see the Dryad cast <strong>Arboreal Storm</strong>, immediately disengage from the tree in order to avoid getting hit. Otherwise, these group of mobs are nothing special.

Upon defeating all the mobs outside, the entrance to the first boss will now open up.
