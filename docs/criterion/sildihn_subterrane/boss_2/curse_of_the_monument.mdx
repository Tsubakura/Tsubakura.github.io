After dodging another set of lasers and dealing with another <Raidwide>Flash of Steel</Raidwide>, the gladiator will prepare its final mechanic. Immediately stand in the center under the gladiator, because the boss will apply chains soon and you do not want to be anywhere near the walls while that happens.

## Curse of the Monument

The gladiator will use <strong>Curse of the Monument</strong>, which will inflict several debuffs on all players.

The distance you need to stretch is dependent on the starting positions of both players when the chains are applied. The two pairs that get chained are always tank/healer and DPS/DPS.<br /><br />After 6 seconds, both players will continuously take damage until either one player dies or when the chain gets broken.</td>

        <td><center><strong>Scream of the Fallen</strong></center><br />Upon the timer running out, a defamation will detonate around this player. Avoid hitting other players with this, as this AoE will inflict magic vulnerability on hit.</td>

Because of how the chain pairs are formed, the party should split in groups of two: MT/D1 and H1/D2. Now from here, the direction in which you run to break the chains are completely dependent on whether you follow the JP or the Materia strategy:

- JP: MT/D1 east, H1/D2 west.
- Materia: MT/D1 north, H1/D2 south.

There's no pros or cons between either, but the party needs to agree on one or the mechanic will fail. 

Once the gladiator casts <strong>Curse of the Monument</strong>, a series of telegraphed AoE will circle around the arena. There are two patterns to look out for which affects the direction you run towards to in order to break your chain, but you can start running towards the wall and adjust on the fly once you've identified which direction you have to go.

## Colossal Wreck

Immediately after breaking your chains and dodging the AoE, the gladiator will hop back into the middle and create two sets of two towers that the party needs to soak. The first set of towers will randomly either spawn north/south or west/east of the boss. The second set of towers cannot spawn in the same spot as the first set, meaning that if the first set is north/south, then the second set will always be west/east and vice versa.

The players marked with 2 need to soak the towers first, while the players with 1 need to run out to the wall in order to resolve their defamation. After the first set of towers has been soaked, the players role are switched and now the 1s soak the tower, while the 2s run out in order to resolve their defamation.

For this mechanic, the snake priority system is used to determine who takes which tower and who takes which cardinal spot for their defamation.

<table width='80%'>
    <tr>
        <th>CW from North</th>
        <td><Role role='MT' /><Role role='D1' /><Role role='D2' /><Role role='H1' /></td>
        <th>CCW from West</th>
    </tr>
</table>

After dealing with the towers, the gladiator will use <Raidwide>Flash of Steel</Raidwide> and then use repeat mechanics from here on. First, the gladiator will do another two sets of <strong>Spectre of Might</strong>, which is the same mechanic as you saw during the beginning of this fight. This is followed by <strong>Sculptor's Passion</strong>, which is the wild charge line stack. And finally, this followed by another cast of <Raidwide>Flash of Steel</Raidwide>. If the gladiator still has not been defeated yet at this point, then it will do a slow cast of <Enrage>Flash of Steel</Enrage> which will wipe the party on the spot if allowed to cast.
