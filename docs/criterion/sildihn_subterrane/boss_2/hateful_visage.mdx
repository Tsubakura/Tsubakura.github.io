The gladiator will cast <strong>Hateful Visage</strong>, which will summon iron statue heads that will shoot beams across the direction its facing while effectively splitting the arena by 2x2. This is followed up by <strong>Wrath of Ruin</strong>, which will summon orb sets that will fire off line AoEs in a grid pattern across the whole arena. Finally while all the mechanics are resolving, the gladiator will use <strong>Nothing Beside Remains</strong> to target all players with a targeted AoE attack, which means that everyone must spread out.

The iron statues will split the arena in quadrants, so you can assign each player to their own quadrants in order to utilize the maximum amount of space while spreading out. You might notice the statues shooting a gold or silver laser, but ignore those colors for now, because getting hit by any lasers is bad during this mechanic.
