The gladiator will cast <strong>Curse of the Fallen</strong>, which will inflict a numerous of debuffs on all players.

Once the debuffs have been applied, your party needs to immediately identify two things.

First, the party need to identify who the players are with <strong>Thunderous Echo</strong> and <strong>Lingering Echoes</strong>. The stack should go west while the player with the <strong>Lingering Echoes</strong> should preferably be east. The other players who have neither will go to west and preposition themselves in order to signal the other players whether they will spread north or south. The next step is checking the timers of the debuffs to determine whether it is stack first or spread first. Once you know which one happens first, then the party should adjust accordingly.

Keep in mind that the clockspots aren't applied for this mechanic, so be flexible when prepositioning! For those who are familiar with DSR, you can use the same prepositioning movement for the meteor towers in P2 in order to notify your party members which spread position you're going to take.

## Ring of Might

The gladiator will jump back to the middle and prepare <strong>Ring of Might</strong>. Upon cast, three rings will appear on the arena. The gladiator will then start charging randomly between 1 to 3 times, with the final charge being a large glow that you've seen before in the last mechanic. Once the gladiator has finished charging, it will use a chariot that goes into a donut. The size of the chariot and donut are dependent on the amount of times the gladiator has charged, which is also outlined by the rings you see.

This is the same mechanic as seen in the variant dungeon, except this is now combined with the echoes debuffs that you have to deal with.

        <th>Stack first</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The player with the stack should go west, while the player with the blue debuff should immediately head east. The remaining players should preposition themselves, so that there will be no confusion as to who goes north and south.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the gladiator will most likely be casting <strong>Ring of Might</strong> at this point. Keep your eyes on the boss and identify how many times the boss has charged up. For this example, the boss has charged up two times.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>The gladiator will now use its chariot. At the same time, the first set of debuff mechanics will resolve.<br /><br />This is your cue to immediately move into the zone where the chariot went off, because a donut will soon follow. Move in and stack or spread as necessary, depending on which debuff had resolved first.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>The donut now appears and the last set of debuff should now be resolved.<br /><br />If you were the player with the <strong>Lingering Echoes</strong>, then remember to get out of the lingering AoE that you left behind in order to avoid taking more damage.</td>

The positions in the above diagrams should allow the party to resolve the mechanics safely while minimizing the chances of accidentally clipping each other with the AoEs. If the gladiator has charged 2 or 3 times, then feel free to drop the <strong>Lingering Echoes</strong> wherever you want, as long as its not on top of the other players.

The gladiator will wrap this mechanic up with a <Raidwide>Flash of Steel</Raidwide> once the dust settles.
