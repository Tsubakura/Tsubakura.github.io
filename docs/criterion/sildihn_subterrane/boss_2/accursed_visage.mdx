After dodging the lasers and dealing with another <Raidwide>Flash of Steel</Raidwide>, the gladiator will now use <strong>Accursed Visage</strong>. This mechanic is exactly the same as the previous mechanic, but you now have to deal with some debuffs as well that the boss applies on you.

You now have to intentionally get hit by the opposite element in order to cleanse the debuff. Failure to do so will result in instant death once the timer runs out.<br /><br />Remember, it is the opposite laser color that you need to get hit by, not the laser of the same color as your debuff. If you have both colors, then that means you have to get hit by both lasers at the same time.</td>

Identify your debuff and immediately head into a quadrant that matches the lasers that you need to cleanse your debuff. The debuffs are assigned in a way that it always allows each player to have their own quadrant, so try avoid clumping together with another player in the same quadrant.<br /><br />
