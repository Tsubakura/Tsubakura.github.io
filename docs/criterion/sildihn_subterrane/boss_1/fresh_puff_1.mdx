Silkie's gimmick revolves around summoning fresh puffs and applying enchantments on either those puffs or its own tail. Whenever Silkie applies an enchantment on its own tail, it will cast one of the following:
- **Fizzling Suds**: Applies a lightning enchantment.
- **Bracing Suds**: Applies a wind enchantment.
- **Chilling Suds**: Applies an ice enchantment.

With an active enchantment, Silkie can apply the same element on the puffs whenever it uses attacks that dashes through the puffs. If a puff or its own tail already had an active enchantment, then Silkie will overwrite it instead.

Silkie will resolve its own tail whenever it uses <strong>Soap's Up</strong> or <strong>Slippery Soap</strong>, with <strong>Slippery Soap</strong> being a wild charge attack that is telegraphed by a stack marker. If <strong>Soaping Spree</strong> is used instead, then Silkie's tail and all the puffs will be resolved at the same time. Each element reacts differently, so check the table below as to what to expect when the tail or puffs resolve.

Silkie will immediately demonstrate this at the start by casting <strong>Fizzling Suds</strong> to enchant its tail with lightning, which is followed up by <strong>Soap's Up</strong> to resolve it. Simply stand in any cardinal direction of the boss in order to not get hit by the protean that comes out of the boss.

After resolving the opener mechanic, the boss will use <strong>Dust Bluster</strong>, which is a knockback, to re-center itself in preparation for its first major mechanic.

## Fresh Puff 1

Silkie will use <strong>Fresh Puff</strong> to summon three puffs into the arena, which are randomly enchanted with either ice or lightning elements. The locations of these puffs are always fixed: One at north, one at southwest and one at southeast. Ignore the puffs for now, because Silkie will now use <strong>Bracing Suds</strong> and follow this up with <strong>Squeaky Clean</strong> to sweep the arena.

Immediately stack up behind the boss and identify which direction Silkie slants first. The direction in which Silkie slants first will also be the safe side for you to dodge its sweep. 

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Dodge left</th>
        <th>Dodge right</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='ass/boss1/fresh_puff_1_squeaky_clean_left.webm' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='ass/boss1/fresh_puff_1_squeaky_clean_right.webm' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

Notice how two of the three puffs have now been converted into the wind element after the boss swept through them? This is a problem, because having two donuts resolve at once means that you have no safe spots anywhere on the map. To combat this, Silkie will now coat itself with <strong>Chilling Suds</strong> and cast <strong>Slippery Soap</strong> to charge at the party. Your goal now is to bait the charge into converting one of the two wind puffs into an ice puff. To determine which puff you have to convert, you need to identify which puff would be struck by the remaining ice/lightning puff if all puffs were to resolve.

<table width='50%'>
    <tr>
        <th width='50%'>Lightning will hit the northern puff, aim the stack north!</th>
        <th width='50%'>Ice will hit the southeastern puff, aim the stack southeast!</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='ass/boss1/fresh_puff_1_chilling_sud_north.png' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='ass/boss1/fresh_puff_1_chilling_sud_southeast.png' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

Once identified, the player with the stack marker must now stand **behind** the puff that they wish to coat with ice, as Silkie must dash through the puff in order for the ice to apply on the puff. <strong>Slippery Soap</strong> is a wild charge, so the tank must be in front of the stack in order for any other party members to not take heavy damage. And finally, respect motion when Silkie charges at you, or you will be turned into a living popsicle and likely be finished off by the followup attack.

<KittenAsset path='ass/boss1/slippery_soap_ice.webm' wrapper='div' />

After converting the correct puff and dodging the followup attack, Silkie will cast <Tankbuster>Carpet Beater</Tankbuster> on the player with the highest enmity. This tankbuster will cause the boss to pound on the target, so make use of this opportunity to bait the boss into the remaining donut in order to maximize your uptime. The tankbuster does not inflict AoE, so you do not have to worry about accidentally hitting a party member when baiting Silkie.

Once in place, the boss will now cast <strong>Soaping Spree</strong> to resolve all the puffs. If everything has been done correctly, then the puffs will not hit any of the party members.

<table width='80%'>
    <tr>
        <th>Example 1</th>
        <th>Example 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='ass/boss1/fresh_puff_1_example1.png' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='ass/boss1/fresh_puff_1_chilling_sud_southeast.png' /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='ass/boss1/fresh_puff_1_example1.webm' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='ass/boss1/fresh_puff_1_example2.webm' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

After resolving all the puffs, Silkie will end the first mechanic by casting <Raidwide>Total Wash</Raidwide>, which is a raidwide with a strong bleed effect. Make sure to properly mitigate this, as the bleed hurts a lot, especially on savage difficulty.
