Silkie will first cast <Raidwide>Total Wash</Raidwide>, which is the usual raidwide with bleed. Once you've dealt with that, Silkie will now cast <strong>Fresh Puff</strong> for the third time.

## Fresh Puff 3

Silkie will summon eight puffs that are coated with either wind, lightning or ice. This is followed up with a cast of <strong>Eastern Ewers</strong>, which will summon three ewers that will wash off the element on six of the puffs. Once the ewers has passed you, Silkie will use <strong>Soaping Spree</strong> to resolve the two remaining puffs that weren't washed off by the ewers.

<br />

With two of the puffs resolved, you are now left with six puffs in a neutral state. Your goal in this mechanic is to eliminate all the remaining puffs, as failure to do so will make [Fresh Puff 4](/criterion/sildihn_subterrane/boss_1/fresh_puff_4) unresolvable without your party taking heavy damage. You can resolve the puffs by having Silkie coat them with an element, which allows the puffs to be resolvable through <strong>Soaping Spree</strong>. The boss grants you that opportunity, as it casts <strong>Chilling Suds</strong> in preparation to charge at you again.
