Hopefully, you have resolved all the puffs in the last mechanic. Regardless whether you did or not, Silkie will use <strong>Dust Bluster</strong> to reposition itself up north. This is followed up by <strong>Bracing Suds</strong> and the final cast of <strong>Fresh Puff</strong> of this fight.

Keep in mind that you are unlikely to skip this mechanic on savage.


## Fresh Puff 4

Four ice puffs will drop down on the arena in a straight line in the middle, each of them tethering to each player similarly to how they behave in [Fresh Puff 2](/criterion/sildihn_subterrane/boss_1/fresh_puff_2). Shortly after, Silkie will use <strong>Squeaky Clean</strong> to sweep the arena. Because of Silkie's tail being a wind element, your goal here is to make sure the ice puff you're tethered to does **not** get hit by Silkie's sweep as you do not want multiple donuts to go off at the same time.

If [Fresh Puff 3](/criterion/sildihn_subterrane/boss_1/fresh_puff_3) was done improperly, then there will be leftover puffs on the map. You will have to hope that Silkie does not sweep them or you will not survive the upcoming <strong>Soaping Spree</strong>.

For this mechanic, you can utilize an uptime strat that is popularized by [ZizieZip](https://x.com/ZizieZip/status/1582428624392626176).

        <td width='50%'>Once the puffs are baited, navigate yourself northwards so that you end up inside Silkie's hitbox. You should be safe from the <strong>Soaping Spree</strong> you're directly north, but if you want to be sure, you can nudge slightly more to the side that got cleaved by Silkie in order to dodge the line AoEs from the ice puffs. <br />If any of the puffs have been converted into wind, then be prepared to mitigate. You can survive 1 mistake with mitigations, but no more, especially on savage difficulty.<br /><br /><KittenAsset path='ass/boss1/fresh_puff_4_example.webm' /></td>

After you've survived the last set of fresh puffs, Silkie will cast <Raidwide>Total Wash</Raidwide>. If Silkie is not defeated at this point, then you will see Silkie change to a random element and use <strong>Slippery Soap</strong>. If Silkie is still not defeated at this point after having used <strong>Slippery Soap</strong> twice, then Silkie will cast a slow final <Enrage>Total Wash</Enrage> that will wipe the party if allowed to cast.
