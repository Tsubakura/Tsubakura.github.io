After the raidwide, Silkie will now either coat its own tail with ice or wind. This is followed up by another cast of <strong>Fresh Puff</strong>, which will summon four puffs that are either placed cardinally or intercardinally. 

## Fresh Puff 2

Four puffs, two ice and two lightning, will drop on each cardinal or intercardinal positions of the arena. Each of these puffs will randomly tether to one player and after a set time expires, will leap a set distance (two tiles) towards the direction of the player it is tethered to. After the puffs have leaped, the boss will cast <strong>Soaping Spree</strong> to resolve its tails and all the puffs. Thus, your goal as a party is to move the puffs in a way that allows your party to dodge the attacks.

There are 8 possible combinations, but instead of trying to remember each and every one of the combinations, here are some very simple rules you can use to consistenly resolve **all** of them:
- Lightning puffs always goes away from the center towards the wall, there are no exceptions.
- Ice puffs movements are determined by the element on Silkie's tail:
  - **Ice**: Follow the same rules as lightning, move it away from the center.
  - **Wind**: Aim the ice puff towards a wall, but **do not point it diagonally** as you do not want to aim the ice at the center.
- Stay away from the same diagonal corner as where the ice puff started in case Silkie's tail is ice as well.

Try to start around the middle of the arena, as the puff you will get tethered to is completely random. If needed, pop your sprint as you will likely not need it until the last mechanic of this boss.
