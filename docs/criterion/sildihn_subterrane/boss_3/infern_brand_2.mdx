The boss will cast the 2nd iteration of <strong>Infern Brand</strong> here, which will summon four blue laser wires and four red laser wires. These wires are numbered from 1 to 4 and must be cut in the correct order. Not everyone can willy nilly cut any wire though, as when the boss summoned the wires, he also inflicted a debuff on every party member.

The distance you need to stretch is dependent on the starting positions of both players when the chains are applied. The two pairs that get chained are always tank/healer and DPS/DPS.<br /><br />After 6 seconds, both players will continuously take damage until either one player dies or when the chain gets broken.</td>
