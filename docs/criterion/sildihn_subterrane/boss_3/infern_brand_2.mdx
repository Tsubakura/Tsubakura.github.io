The boss will cast the 2nd iteration of <strong>Infern Brand</strong> here, which will summon four blue laser wires and four red laser wires. These wires are numbered from 1 to 4 and must be cut in the correct order. Not everyone can willy nilly cut any wire though, as when the boss summoned the wires, he also inflicted a debuff on every party member.


WIP... will finish someday...
