Athena will cast <Raidwide>The Classical Concepts</Raidwide> again, which will again summon a 3x4 grid of orbs on the field. However, this version of Classical Concept comes with a twist compared to how the first one works. During this mechanic, Athena will cast <strong>Panta Rhei</strong>, which will flip the whole orb grid by 180 degrees. Another difference compared to the first Classical Concept, is that Athena will now cast <strong>Palladian Ray</strong> before the orbs explode. This will limit the available space for the ray baits, because the players need to be able to dodge the exploding orbs after the bait.

## Panta Rhei
The orb grid will be flipped 180 degrees in an attempt to throw off the players, but the way you resolve this mechanic is the same. Keep in mind that there exists patterns that would basically resolve itself even if it flips by 180 degrees, but you are expected to always move regardless because at the same time, not all patterns are cheesable. PF will not check constantly which patterns are cheesable and which aren't.

For Classical Concepts 2, the universally accepted spread for <strong>Palladian Ray</strong> is the X-pattern.

Once the party has successfully dealt with this mechanic, Athena will wrap this mechanic up by casting <Raidwide>Ultima</Raidwide> and then follow it up by casting <Tankbuster>Crush Helm</Tankbuster>. Nothing has changed since the last time, so the party can deal with this tankbuster the same way as they did the first.
