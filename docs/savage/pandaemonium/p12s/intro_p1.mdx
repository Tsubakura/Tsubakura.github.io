P12S consists of two phases. For phase two, check out [part 2](/savage/p12s_p2) of this fight.

The strategy is mostly the same across all datacenters:
- Aether uses [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/gc93tBFY).
  - Aether has DPS go CCW and support go CW in Paradeigma 2.
  - Tanks need to flex for the healers in Paradeigma 3 if they both get the tower debuff.
  - DPS positions are fixed depending on how your tethers are stretched.
- Elemental and Mana follows [Nukemaru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkCG_VH4sI4).
  - JP has support go CCW and DPS go CW in Paradeigma 2.
  - Supports with towers and DPS all respect a priority system in Paradeigma 3 to decide who soaks which tower.

General notes:
- This raid introduces the use of Umbral and Astral elements, which are the light and dark elements.
  - Taking an Umbral/Astral attack will inflict an elemental debuff on the player.
    - This debuff is used to resolve mechanics of the opposite element, like towers and stack lasers.
    - Taking another attack of the same element is fatal and will likely not resolve the mechanic properly.
    - Players cannot soak towers of the same element.
  - Keep this concept in mind, as these elements will make a return in part 2 of this fight.
