After having successfully resolved Caloric Theory 1, Athena will cast <strong>Ekpyrosis</strong>. This attack is an exaflare, proximity explosion and a spread attack combined in one. In order to resolve this mechanic, the party first needs to run to the edge where the exaflares are starting in order to minimize the damage from the proximity explosions. The party then needs to spread out immediately in order to not hit each other with the targeted AoE. Once the spread has been resolved, each player dodges the exaflare that is coming from the other side.

There is not enough room to fit a whole party at one side for the spread attack without causing casualties, so the party needs to split up in two groups in order to deal with this mechanic effectively. The exaflares can start either from west/east or north/south, and depending on where the exaflares starts, the 4:4 split will be either light parties or a split between melees and ranged.

Once <strong>Ekpyrosis</strong> is resolved, Athena will cast <Raidwide>Ultima</Raidwide>. Make sure to heal up and mitigate as necessary, because the party will take quite some damage while resolving <strong>Ekpyrosis</strong>. Everyone needs to be alive for the next mechanic, so the healers should revive anyone who are down as soon as they can.

## Pangenesis
After dealing with the raidwide as usual, Athena will now cast <Raidwide>Pangenesis</Raidwide>, which signals the start of the next major mechanic. The party has the time to do the line up until Athena finishes casting. Remember that Japanese parties do not line up by default, because they can simply determine the priority by looking at the party list instead. North American datacenters however, does not use any fixed priority system for the line up. So if you're from Aether DC, make absolutely sure that you do the line up properly, even if you accidentally forgot your spot. 

Once Athena casts <Raidwide>Pangenesis</Raidwide>, all the players will be inflicted with several debuffs:
- All players will get Stable System which lasts for 10 seconds.
- One player will get a 16s Umbral Tilt and 2 stacks of Unstable Factor.
- One player will get a 16s Astral Tilt and 2 stacks of Unstable Factor.
- One player will get a 20s Umbral Tilt and 2 stacks of Unstable Factor.
- One player will get a 20s Astral Tilt and 2 stacks of Unstable Factor.
- Two players will get 1 stack of Unstable Factor. They will referred as 1.
- Two players will only receive Stable System and nothing else. They will be referred as 0.

Check your debuff once <Raidwide>Pangenesis</Raidwide> is cast! The goal of the line up is for the party to identify who the 1s and 0s are. The 1s and 0s need to know who the other 1s and 0s are, because these players need to split up properly between the west and east halves of the arena. Depending on the strategy used, the 1s and 0s needs to either move up or down after the line up.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="JP" label="1 up 0 down (JP)">

As the strategy suggests, the 1s move up while the 0s move down. This is the strategy used in Elemental and Mana. Keep in mind that Japanese parties do not line up, they use the party list instead to find the 1s and 0s. In this example, ST and D1 moves west, while D2 and D4 moves east.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Aether" label="0+2 (Aether)">

The 0s move up while the 1s move down. This is the preferred approach in Aether. In this example, D2 and H2 moves west, while D3 and MT moves east.

<img src='https://ffxivkittenassets.z7.web.core.windows.net/p12s/pangenesis_line_up_aether.png' />

Keep in mind that the line up is not fixed in Aether DC. The players are free to choose how they want to line up, but the tank who can invuln must always end up at east if he/she gets selected as a 0. The tank with invuln should never end up at the west side, as that will cause problems when the party has to resolve the <Tankbuster>Palladian Grasp</Tankbuster> tankbuster.

After inflicting everyone with the debuffs, Athena will cast <strong>Pantheos</strong>, which will spawn towers that the party needs to soak. Each tower needs to be soaked by two people, and one of the two players needs to have an elemental debuff that is the opposite of the tower. Failure to soak a tower properly will cause it to explode, killing everyone in the party. Upon successfully soaking a tower, one of the player will be inflicted with an elemental debuff that is the same as the tower that was soaked.

There exists only two patterns for the Pantheos towers. The party will not know which pattern they get, until the first set of towers spawn in.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>1st Light tower west<br/>1st Dark tower east</th>
        <th>1st Dark tower west<br/>1st Light tower east</th>

In order to resolve this mechanic, the party needs to soak all towers and resolve all Unstable Factor stacks through fusion at the same time. The Stable System debuff prevents players from fusing at the start, so this means that the party can only fuse when the towers start to appear. This also means that the pair soaking the towers must also be a pair that can fuse correctly. 

This puzzle looks daunting at first, but knowing how this mechanic works will severely limit the amount of possibilities that the players have to deal with. First, the player with the 16s elemental debuff must go to the first tower to counter the element of the tower. Second, the northern tower of the 2nd set of towers is always the opposite of the first tower. The player who gets an elemental debuff on the first tower can resolve the northern tower of the 2nd set, so in order to counteract the element of the southern tower, the 20s will be assigned there. 

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>1st Light tower west<br/>1st Dark tower east</th>
        <th>1st Dark tower west<br/>1st Light tower east</th>

With all the elemental debuffs assigned, the party can now decide whether you have 1s take the first tower or 0s take the first tower. Both are valid options, but they also determine how the subsequent towers needs to be soaked in order to get rid of all the Unstable Factor stacks on all players.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="JP" label="1 up 0 down (JP)">

Elemental and Mana approaches this mechanic by having the 1s soak the first tower. The resulting fusion will produce 1 and 1 Unstable Factor stacks, which forces them to split up for the next set of towers as 1 and 1 cannot fuse together. In order to resolve the fusion at the 2nd set of towers correctly, the 0s need to preposition themselves north at the 2nd set of towers.

Aether approaches this mechanic by having the 0s soak the first tower. The strategy abuses the fact that fusing 0 with a 2 will produce 0 and 1 Unstable Factor stacks, which means the pair can fuse again. This allows the party to eliminate the random factor of having to switch lanes for the first two sets of towers, because the pair at the first tower can both move north for the 2nd set of towers. The 1s will be taking the south tower of the 2nd set in this strategy.

The mechanic is not over yet! Three slimes on each sides have been generated during the fusion process. These slimes will now try to lunge at the players, causing a giant explosion upon impact. At the same time, Athena will cast <Tankbuster>Palladian Grasp</Tankbuster> on the player with the highest enmity, which is the tentacle tankbuster that was seen at the beginning of the fight.

Only the 0s can safely soak the slimes and they need to do so in a way that the explosion doesn't hit anyone else. The slime explosions will inflict stacks of Fourfold-come Ruin, so do not try to grab more than 3 slimes. This should not happen unless you intentionally grab the slimes from the other side. The damage inflicted by the slimes will bypass invulnerability, so do not try to invuln it. If the tank invulning ends up being selected as the 0, then it doesn't matter where the tank stands, as long as the incoming attacks does not end up hitting the party.
