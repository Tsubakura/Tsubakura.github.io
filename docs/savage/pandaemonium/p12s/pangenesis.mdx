After having successfully resolved Caloric Theory 1, Athena will cast <strong>Ekpyrosis</strong>. This attack is an exaflare, proximity explosion and a spread attack combined in one. In order to resolve this mechanic, the party first needs to run to the edge where the exaflares are starting in order to minimize the damage from the proximity explosions. The party then needs to spread out immediately in order to not hit each other with the targeted AoE. Once the spread has been resolved, each player dodges the exaflare that is coming from the other side.

There is not enough room to fit a whole party at one side for the spread attack without causing casualties, so the party needs to split up in two groups in order to deal with this mechanic effectively. The exaflares can start either from west/east or north/south, and depending on where the exaflares starts, the 4:4 split will be either light parties or a split between melees and ranged.

Once <strong>Ekpyrosis</strong> is resolved, Athena will cast <Raidwide>Ultima</Raidwide>. Make sure to heal up and mitigate as necessary, because the party will take quite some damage while resolving <strong>Ekpyrosis</strong>. Everyone needs to be alive for the next mechanic, so the healers should revive anyone who are down as soon as they can.

## Pangenesis
After dealing with the raidwide as usual, Athena will now cast <Raidwide>Pangenesis</Raidwide>, which signals the start of the next major mechanic. The party has the time to do the line up until Athena finishes casting. Remember that Japanese parties do not line up by default, because they can simply determine the priority by looking at the party list instead. North American datacenters however, does not use any fixed priority system for the line up. So if you're from Aether DC, make absolutely sure that you do the line up properly, even if you accidentally forgot your spot. 

Once Athena casts <Raidwide>Pangenesis</Raidwide>, all the players will be inflicted with several debuffs:
- All players will get Stable System which lasts for 10 seconds.
- A random player will get a 16s Umbral Tilt and 2 stacks of Unstable Factor.
- A random player will get a 16s Astral Tilt and 2 stacks of Unstable Factor.
- A random player will get a 20s Umbral Tilt and 2 stacks of Unstable Factor.
- A random player will get a 20s Astral Tilt and 2 stacks of Unstable Factor.
- Two random players will get 1 stack of Unstable Factor.
- Two random players will only receive Stable System and nothing else.

The goal of this mechanic is to get rid of all the Unstable Factor stacks before the timer runs out. If the timer runs out, the player will explode in a DNA mass, killing everyone.</td>

The slimes will use a self-destruct attack on the players at the end by tethering to them, which results in a giant explosion. Having Critical Factor will cause the attack from the slime to become fatal instead. The two players who did not start with Unstable Factors will never get this debuff, allowing them to safely soak the slimes. <br /><br />There are only six players with Unstable Factor, so the amount of slimes generated will always be exactly 6.</td>
