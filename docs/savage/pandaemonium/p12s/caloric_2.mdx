Athena will start casting <Raidwide>Caloric Theory</Raidwide> again to signal the start of Caloric Theory 2. One random player will get a red marker, while the rest get a green marker. Once Athena is done casting, an aero circle will go off on all players with a green marker. Just like Caloric 1, hitting someone else with this attack is fatal because of Close Caloric, so make sure that everyone spreads out in a formation to avoid clipping each other.

Once Athena finishes casting <Raidwide>Caloric Theory</Raidwide>, Athena will inflict the following debuffs on all players:
- All players will start with two stacks of Close Caloric.
  - The player with a red marker will start with three instead, due to taking a fire attack at the start.
- All players will get Atmosfaction.
- One random player with a green marker will get 8 stacks of Entropifaction.
  - The player with a red marker will never start with the Entropifaction.

To resolve this mechanic correctly, the party must let all the Entropifaction stacks run out without it hitting anyone. This would be trivial if everyone had infinite movements, but due to Close Caloric, a single player cannot resolve all the Entropifaction stacks alone. All players with green markers starts with two stacks of Close Caloric, which allows exactly two AoE dodges. The first dodge should always be to pass the debuff to another player while simultaneously dodging the AoE. The second dodge is to get away from the AoE again once the debuff has been passed to another player. The second dodge should always be away from the center, because at the very end of this mechanic, the Atmosfaction will go off and you do not want that to hit anyone by accident. Keep in mind that the player with the red marker starts with three stacks instead, so the Entropifaction should **never** be passed to this player.

All the general rules of Caloric 1 apply here as well! Avoid unnecessary movements and walk in a straight line without doing any weird movements. If you mess up by moving wrongly, then there's no turning back!

Just like Caloric 1, the prepositioning in Caloric 2 is the most important part of this mechanic. The party needs to preposition themselves in a way that allows them to resolve this mechanic as smoothly as possible.

Elemental and Mana follows the Nukemaru video guide for Caloric 2. Nukemaru's approach is to have the MT take the middle spot for flexing and have the party pass the Entropifaction counterclockwise.

Once Caloric 2 is properly resolved, Athena will cast <strong>Ekpyrosis</strong> that is followed up with <Raidwide>Ultima</Raidwide>. Heal up and mitigate as needed. Nothing is different from the last time, so the party can resolve this mechanic the same way as last time.
