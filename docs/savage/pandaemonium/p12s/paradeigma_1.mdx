Athena will start the battle by casting <Raidwide>On the Soul</Raidwide>, which is a generic raidwide attack. This is then immediately followed up with a cast of <strong>Paradeigma</strong>, which will summon four angels that will blast two closest target each with a laser beam. While the angels are beaming people, Athena will also use <strong>Trinity of Souls</strong> to cleave the arena sides three times.

## Paradeigma 1
The angels will either spawn at the northern half or the southern half of the arena, and the intended way of resolving this mechanic is to have four people each taking turns baiting the pair of angels. However, the universally accepted strategy is to cheese this mechanic instead by having both tanks use their invuln to soak all the laser beams from the angels. This means that everyone only have to dodge <strong>Trinity of Souls</strong> without having to worry about the lasers once they get to their correct starting positions.

Identify where the angels spawns and get into position in anticipation of the next mechanic, which is <strong>Trinity of Souls</strong>.

## Trinity of Souls

Athena will cast <strong>Trinity of Souls</strong>, which is the same half arena cleaves as seen in the normal version. The big difference though, is that the wings now light up from bottom to top, which means that Athena will do a 180 degree spin every time she performs the cleave. This means that Athena will cleave inverse after the first cleave, so you need to react accordingly depending on how the wings light up.

There are only three possible patterns and below is an example as to how you can dodge each pattern. The trick to the patterns is looking for whether Athena is trying to cleave the same side twice in a row based on the light patterns.

    <tr>
        <td><center>Cleave 1 and 2 are the same<br />Dodge after the 1st cleave</center></td>
        <td><center>Cleave 2 and 3 are the same<br />Dodge after the 2nd cleave</center></td>
        <td><center>No twice cleaves on the same side in a row<br />Stand still and let it resolve</center></td>
    </tr>

The mechanic is not over yet. The consequence of cheesing this mechanic through tank invulns is that the MT now has to take on an auto attack with a magic vulnerability. The MT needs to be supermitigated with the help of the other supports in order to survive the incoming auto attack. There's only one auto attack before the magic vulnerability drops off, so afterwards, the healers can take their time to heal up the MT.
