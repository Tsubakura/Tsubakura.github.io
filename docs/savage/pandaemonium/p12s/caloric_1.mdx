Athena will cast <Tankbuster>Crush Helm</Tankbuster>, which is a five-hitting tankbuster that targets the two players with the highest enmity. The tankbuster will first deal four small strikes which inflicts a stack of vulnerability debuff each. After the initial four strikes, the 5th strike will be the actual tankbuster that deals a high amount of damage that is fatal to anyone that isn't a tank. The vulnerability debuff stacks can be cleansed with either <strong>Esuna</strong> (healers) or <strong>The Warden's Paean</strong> (BRD). If the vulnerabilities are not cleansed in time, then the resulting tankbuster will be fatal to the tanks.

The standard method of dealing with this mechanic is to assign one healer to each tank and cleanse the debuff before the 5th strike happens, but there are some other non-standard ways of dealing with this mechanic if the party contains certain roles:
- If the party has a WAR, then the other tank can opt to just use his invuln instead.
  - Keep in mind that the tank cannot use his/her invuln again for the rest of the fight.
- A PLD can soak all the debuff stacks by using <strong>Cover</strong> on his/her co-tank, which means only one person is required to cleanse the PLD.
  - The PLD can go even a step further by having everyone in the party hyper mitigate the PLD, which allows the PLD to take both tankbusters alone.
  - Otherwise, both tanks needs to start running in opposite directions after the third hit in order to break the <strong>Cover</strong>.
- BRD have <strong>The Warden's Paean</strong>, which is basically an instant cast <strong>Esuna</strong>. 
  - The BRD can effectively replace one of the healers in the cleansing duty.
  - If the party has both a BRD and a PLD, then the mechanic can be resolved without involving any healers.

For reference regarding the Esuna cast timing, the healers must start casting Esuna on the 3rd stack or the cleanse will not happen on time.

## Caloric Theory 1

Once the tankbuster has been resolved, Athena will now start casting <Raidwide>Caloric Theory</Raidwide> to signal the start of the next major mechanic. During the cast, one random support and one random DPS will have a fire beacon glowing above their heads.
<img src='https://ffxivkittenassets.z7.web.core.windows.net/p12s/caloric_fire_beacons.png' />

The fire beacon does two things. First, it guarantees that this player will get the Atmosfaction debuff, which will be explained in the next section below. Second, one of the two fire beacons will take a two-man stack attack once Athena finishes casting <Raidwide>Caloric Theory</Raidwide>. Taking this attack alone is fatal and will cause Caloric Theory 1 to become unresolvable before it even begins.

Once <Raidwide>Caloric Theory</Raidwide> goes off, Athena will inflict a numerous of debuffs on all players:
- All players will get Close Caloric.
- Four players will receive Atmosfaction with a 23 seconds timer.
  - The players with a fire beacon are guaranteed to receive Atmosfaction.
- Four players will receive Pyrefaction with 12 seconds timer.
  - After the first Pyrefaction goes off, two random players will be selected again for Pyrefaction.
- A player can never get both Pyrefaction and Atmosfaction at the same time.

If the stack ever hits 5, then the player will explode and wipe the party.

Players with Pyrefaction are easily recognizable by a giant flame above their head. <br /><br />Although a non-Pyrefaction player can soak multiple Pyrefaction blasts and survive, it  will still cause a wipe later on due to the player having accumulated too many Close Caloric stacks.</td>

</table>

In order to resolve this mechanic correctly, each player with Pyrefaction needs to stack together with someone who does not have a Pyrefaction debuff. The players with Atmosfaction in the meantime must make sure that their aero does not hit anyone once it goes off. Resolving Pyrefaction will inevitably increase your Close Caloric stacks due to the fire damage taken, so each player will only have 9 yalms worth of movement at most to resolve Caloric Theory 1. As a general rule, avoid unnecessary movements and walk in a straight line without doing any weird movements. If you mess up by moving wrongly, then there's no turning back!

This mechanic would be fairly straightforward, if it weren't for the fact that the movements are limited due to Close Caloric. Thus, in order for the party to deal with this situation effectively, the party needs to quickly preposition themselves in a way that allows them to resolve all the incoming mechanics with the least amount of movements as possible. How the party should preposition is dependent on the strategy used to resolve Caloric Theory 1.

<TabItem value="Elemental" label="Role-based Papan (Elemental)" default>

Elemental uses the role-based papan. This version of Papan fixes all ranged players on the waymarks as part of the initial setup. Everyone else stacks in the center. The two-man stack on the fire beacon is resolved by making use of its large explosion range, which allows the party in the center to help stack it. The west waymark is reserved for the support fire beacon while the east waymark is reserved for the DPS fire beacon.

Some general tips to keep in mind while doing Caloric 1:
- It is not necessary to be exactly on top of your partner when resolving Pyrefaction. Simply being close to them is sufficient.
- Take your time. You have more than 10 seconds before each Pyrefaction stack goes off.
- You can preemptively move to your correct spot by looking at the debuffs of other players in order to calculate ahead.
- Players with Pyrefaction have a giant flame above their head. Use that to your advantage.
