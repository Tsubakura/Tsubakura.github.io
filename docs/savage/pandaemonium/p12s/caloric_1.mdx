Athena will cast <Tankbuster>Crush Helm</Tankbuster>, which is a five-hitting tankbuster that targets the two players with the highest enmity. The tankbuster will first deal four small strikes which inflicts a stack of vulnerability debuff each. After the initial four strikes, the 5th strike will be the actual tankbuster that deals a high amount of damage that is fatal to anyone that isn't a tank. The tankbuster is fatal to tanks if they have a vulnerability stack.
