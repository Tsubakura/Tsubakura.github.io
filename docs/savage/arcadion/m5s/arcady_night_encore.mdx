Dancing Green will summon his backup dancers again with <strong>Ensemble Assemble</strong>. This mechanic is basically a repeat of [Arcady Night Fever](/savage/m5s/arcady_night_fever), albeit with a few minor differences. And just like [Arcady Night Fever](/savage/m5s/arcady_night_fever), the <strong>Grooviness</strong> meter makes a return.

## Arcady Night Encore

The first mechanic plays out exactly the same as [Arcady Night Fever](/savage/m5s/arcady_night_fever). You've seen this before, so this shouldn't be a problem for you to execute.

## Let's Dance! Remix

There's no wavelength debuffs to deal with this time, so your sole focus in this mechanic is dodging the half-room cleaves. However, the big difference here is that the cleaves are no longer restricted to left or right. The frogs can now point forward or backward, which means the half-room cleaves can occur from any direction.

This doesn't change our plans however, so use your quick thinking to skillfully dodge all the attacks and score another <strong>Perfect Groove</strong>. You can make it easier for yourself by only utilizing the four square tiles in the center, under the boss.
