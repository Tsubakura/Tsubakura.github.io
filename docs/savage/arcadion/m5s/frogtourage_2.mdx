Dancing Green will cast <strong>Frogtourage</strong> for a second time, but unlike last time, the frogs will come in waves, with each having their own mechanics that you have to deal with.

## Do the Hustle

The first two pair of frogs will both prepare to do their half-room cleaves, in the style of the first boss of Another Mount Rokkon. The direction they're cleaving can be identified through the direction of the hands they're raising or by looking at the sides of the frogs for a glowy circle. Dancing Green himself will then do his own <strong>Do the Hustle</strong> once the frogs are gone.

There are no tricks for this mechanic, but what you could do is identify some patterns which you can remember and solve quickly. One tip that might be worth trying as a start, is to try and move towards the opposite direction of the direction that the frog hands are pointed towards. And of course, staying as center as possible will also help in being able to make quick dodges.

## Back-Up Dance

The next wave is four protean shooting frogs and one pair of moonwalking frogs, both which comes in two sets. There is no debuff involved, so use the knowledge you've gained from [Frogtourage 1](/savage/m5s/frogtourage_1) to determine the shape of the moonwalk and have the **support bait the first set, while the DPS baits the second set**. The cone shooting frogs will always spawn intercardinally, so that is also one less variable that you have to deal with.

    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m5s/frogtourage2_backupdance_pattern1.png' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m5s/frogtourage2_backupdance_pattern2.png' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m5s/frogtourage2_backupdance_pattern3.png' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m5s/frogtourage2_backupdance_pattern4.png' /></td>

The clockspot partners are in use in this mechanic, so keep in mind that the following partners are interchangeable in the above diagrams:

<Role role='MT' /><Role role='D3' /> <Role role='ST' /><Role role='D2' /> <Role role='H1' /><Role role='D1' /> <Role role='H2' /><Role role='D4' />

<KittenAsset path='m5s/frogtourage2_backupdance_example.webm' wrapper='div' />

Now, as if to test your reflexes, the <strong>Do the Hustle</strong> frogs are back for one last time. This time however, the boss himself will also fire his own <strong>Do the Hustle</strong> in coordination with his two frogs. This changes very little however, so identify the safe spot and dodge accordingly to how you're used to.

After dealing with the final set of frogs, the boss will reward your efforts with a <Tankbuster>Deep Cut</Tankbuster>, which your tanks should be able to deal with efficiently.

## Funky Floor

The funky floor is back, but without the spotlights this time. Dancing Green will use <strong>Quarter Beats</strong> and <strong>Eighth Beats</strong> in a random order while you are dealing with the tiles, while also throwing in either <strong>Inside Out</strong> or <strong>Outside In</strong> inbetween the beats.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Example 1<br /><Role role='H2' /></th>
        <th>Example 2<br /><Role role='D3' /></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m5s/frogtourage2_funkyfloor_example1.webm' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m5s/frogtourage2_funkyfloor_example2.webm' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

These mechanics are not hard compared to what you've faced before and just like any other mechanics from here on, they are there to provide you with time in order to defeat the boss before he enrages. With that said, its not free, so do focus on mechanics as it would be tragic to wipe your party here. Upon resolving the 2nd beats, Dancing Green will cast <Raidwide>Celebrate Good Times</Raidwide> twice in a row, which is a sign that the enrage is coming.

If the boss is still not defeated at this point, then Dancing Green will bring back his army of frogs with <strong>Frogtourage Finale</strong>. He will then follow up with a cast of <Enrage>Hi-NRG Fever</Enrage>. If the boss is still not defeated before the cast fills up, then this attack will wipe your party on the spot, with Dancing Green thanking you for giving him one helluva party.
