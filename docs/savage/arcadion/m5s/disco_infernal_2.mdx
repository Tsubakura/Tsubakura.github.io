## Disco Infernal 2

<strong>Disco Infernal</strong> makes a return. Similarly to its first iteration, it will inflict <strong>Burn Baby Burn</strong> on all players, with two different timers separated by the role groups.<br /><br />

        <th>Debuff</th>

        <td><img src={burn_baby_burn_icon_hr} /></td>
        <td><center><strong>Burn Baby Burn</strong></center><br />Once the timer of this debuff runs out, you are forced to pose under a spotlight. If you fail to pose, either due to taking damage while posing, failing to get under a spotlight or sharing a spotlight with someone else who is also posing, then you will instantly die from <strong>Shame</strong>.<br /><br />One role group starts with 9s, while the other role group starts with 19s.</td>

Similarly to the [Disco Infernal 1](/savage/m5s/disco_1), your goal is to stand under a spotlight when the debuff timer runs out. There is no funky floors this time, but you will be dealing with frogs instead that shoots a cone at the closest player.

The goal of this party is simple: One role group will be posing under the spotlight, while the other group will be baiting the frog cones in a way that doesn't hit the other players. Once the first set is done, the roles will switch around for the second set. The players who posed first will now bait the frog cone, so that the other role group can safely pose under the spotlight.

Overally, not a hard mechanic, but everyone needs to know their positions if the party wants to pass this mechanic without casualties. The four frogs and the four spotlights can all spawn either intercardinally or cardinally, so for this mechanic, the default clockspot will be used, with the support and DPS swapping around as needed for their role. Below is an image of all the possible spotlights and frogs spawn locations, and the player assignments of said entities.

Below are some examples you can use as reference.

Dancing Green has most likely have used <strong>Flip to A/B-Side</strong> somewhere during this mechanic, because he will now cast <strong>x-snap Twist & Drop the Needle</strong> once you're done posing. Regardless whether you were paying attention or not, it does not matter as you can simply answer his challenge with our favorite braindead strategy. This is then followed up by a cast of <Raidwide>Celebrate Good Times</Raidwide>. Heal up and mitigate as needed.
