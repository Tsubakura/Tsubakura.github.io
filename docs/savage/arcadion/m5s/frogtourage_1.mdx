Dancing Green casts <strong>Frogtourage</strong>, which summons two pairs of broccoli afro frogs onto the arena. These frogs will then proceed to stylishly moonwalk all over the arena, creating rectangles in the process that will detonate once the frogs are done dancing. 

## Frogtourage 1

The frogs have two known dance patterns, which will determine what kind of shape they will draw on the floor. You can immediately tell which shape a pair of frogs will be drawing by whether they moonwalk into each other or moonwalk away from each other once they reach the wall. 

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Away from each other pattern</th>
        <th>Into each other pattern</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m5s/frogtourage_moonwalk_away.png' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m5s/frogtourage_moonwalk_into.png' /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m5s/frogtourage_moonwalk_away_example.png' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m5s/frogtourage_moonwalk_into_example.png' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

For this specific mechanic, you will never be confronted by both pairs drawing the same shape, which means theres only two possible patterns of safe spots out of all the possible permutations. This also means you only ever need to look at one pair of the frogs to immediately determine where the safe spots are through process of elimination.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>North/South</th>
        <th>West/East</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m5s/frogtourage1_northsouth.png' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m5s/frogtourage1_westeast.png' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

Dancing Green will try to make this harder by randomly casting either <strong>Quarter Beats</strong> or <strong>Eighth Beats</strong>, but this shouldn't be posing a problem for you once you've identified your safe spot. In case of <strong>Quarter Beats</strong>, have the tank stack with melee, and the ranged DPS stack with the healer, by shuffling towards each other.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Example 1<br />Quarter Beats, North/South<br /><Role role='MT' /></th>
        <th>Example 2<br />Eighth Beats, West/East<br /><Role role='H2' /></th>
        <th>Example 1<br />Quarter Beats, West/East<br /><Role role='D4' /></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>

        <td><KittenAsset path='m5s/frogtourage1_example2.webm' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m5s/frogtourage1_example3.webm' /></td>
    </tr>
