Dancing Green will use <strong>Flip to A/B-Side</strong> here, but as usual, ignore it and focus on the next mechanic that is coming at you.

## Ride the Waves

The boss will cast <strong>Ride the Waves</strong>, which will generate a wave of exasquares that are coming at you from the north. There are two openings in the exaline that your party can utilize, so split your party up in two light parties, with light party 1 taking west while light party 2 takes east.

If one of the openings is all the way at the east, then as MT, you want to slightly pull the boss towards east before going into your own opening so that the other group can maintain their melee uptime.

Now, Dancing Green will use both <strong>Quarter Beats</strong> and <strong>Eighth Beats</strong> in a random order, which your party must resolve while they are riding the waves. For reference, <strong>Quarter Beats</strong> are pair stacks while <strong>Eighth Beats</strong> is a spread.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Quarter Beats (pair)</th>
        <th>Eighth Beats (spread)</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m5s/ride_the_waves_quarter.png' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m5s/ride_the_waves_eighth.png' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

This mechanic is pretty straightforward, so pair up or spread out as needed. At the end of the waves, the boss will then randomly cast either <strong>Inside Out</strong> or <strong>Outside In</strong>. Be careful as the exalines are still there, so try to dodge this mechanic from the north if possible.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Example 1</th>
        <th>Example 2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m5s/ride_the_waves_example1.webm' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m5s/ride_the_waves_example2.webm' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

Once you're done with the waves, Dancing Green will use its recurring <strong>x-snap Twist & Drop the Needle</strong> and <Tankbuster>Deep Cut</Tankbuster>, attacks which you should be very familiar with at this point. These two casts are then followed up with a <Raidwide>Celebrate Good Times</Raidwide>.
