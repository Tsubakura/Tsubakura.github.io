Game8 follows [Nukemaru](https://youtu.be/9fMy4yJRNTM?si=G15W5ym0Rni38T9w)
- JP PFs no longer rotates the boss around during [Orbital Omen](/savage/m11s/orbital_omen), you are to keep the boss perfectly pointed north as the MT.
- The first <Tankbuster>Great Wall of Fire</Tankbuster> can be invulned by every tank except the PLD if the intention is to use the invuln again for the enrage towers.
  - The second <Tankbuster>Great Wall of Fire</Tankbuster> is almost always shared.
- JP PFs are split between DXA (game8) and TotanV2 strategy for resolving Ecliptic Stampede.
  - On the English side, TotanV2 is also known as Fixed Stampede but with a different priority system for ranged.
- By far the most popular way to deal with [Heartbreak Kick](/savage/m11s/heartbreak_kick) is 822.
  - Alternate setups exists, like 812 and 182, but are more rare.

## Setup

There are two waymarks going around which are used to resolve [Majestic Meteor](/savage/m11s/majestic_meteor). Elemental has used the middle-safe waymark during early weeks, while Mana (game8) uses the corner-safe waymark instead. Avoid using the Elemental week 1 waymarks in Mana, as they have caused wipes in JP parties due to the confusion in the different safe spots.
