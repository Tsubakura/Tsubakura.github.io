There are two strategies circulating in PF, so double check the PF description whether it is boss-relative or true north. The last thing you want is to cause a wipe because you didn't bother to read the PF description or ask which strategy the group is using. Keep in mind that by doing boss-relative, you will also resolve all the mechanics relative to the clone! As the tank, you will have to spin the boss around to match the direction the clone is facing.

Black Cat will now cast <strong>Nine Lives</strong> again. The mechanic is similar to the first Nine Lives, but with a few added twists. First, the boss will leap to left/right during her attacks, which will be mimicked by the clones. The second difference is that there will now be two clones with each their own attack and the boss will randomly select one of them, effectively turning this mechanic into a big memory check. And finally, the third difference is that while the clones are executing their attacks, the boss herself will add an extra mechanic that the party needs to resolve, which the party needs to adjust to.

Once the boss finishes casting <strong>Nine Lives</strong>, the boss will follow this up with a <strong>Leaping One-two Paw</strong>. Remember which way the boss leaps, which sides got cleaved first and where the clone spawns, because the boss will now create a clone using <strong>Soulshade</strong> and the clone will mimick the exact movements that the boss did.

Right after creating the first clone, the boss will change her orientation and cast <strong>Leaping Quadruple Crossing</strong>. Keep in mind that this is the only time that the orientation of the boss is not north, so if the agreed strategy is boss relative, make sure to adjust accordingly to the new north. Otherwise, resolve the proteans as usual with the agreed upon strategy.

After spawning the second clone, your memory will now be tested as the boss will randomly target one of the two clones to execute one of the previous mechanics. If you're the MT, pull the boss to the center (unless you know both clones jumps to the same side, in which you pull the boss to that side) and wait for the boss to target one of the clones. Once you see one of the clones targeted, prepare to resolve the mechanics that is tied to the clone. Below is a chronological order of the events happening, using true north and inumaru spread.

<table width='80%'>
    <tr>
        <td width='30%'>The boss leaps to the left and cleaves the inside first. The clone is then spawned at C looking at north. This means the south clone will leap left to 3 and cleave inside first when it gets activated.<br /><br /> Keep in mind that this is an example. The first clone can spawn at either A or C, and the boss could've leaped towards right instead.<br /><br /><KittenAsset path='m1s/nine_lives_leaping_one_two_paw_1.webm' /></td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The boss now turns sideways and leaps to the right to do her proteans. The clone is spawned at A looking down south. Thus, this clone will leap right to 4 if activated. 3 and 4 are on the same side, so the MT should now prepull the boss towards D in preparation for the next incoming mechanics. <br /><br /><KittenAsset path='m1s/nine_lives_leaping_quadruple_crossing_2.webm' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m1s/nine_lives_two_2.png' /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>We now see that the southern clone gets waken up, so immediately move the boss towards 3 and stay outside (in gets cleaved first) to resolve the <strong>Leaping One-two Paw</strong>. At the same time, the boss casts <strong>Tempestuous Tear</strong> on both healers, which are light party stacks.</td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m1s/nine_lives_two_1.webm' /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>The north clone is next, so move up to 4. The added twist here is that the boss herself will cast <strong>Nailchipper</strong>, which targets either all supports or all DPS with a large AoE signified by an arrow on their head. The group with these arrows on their <strong>cannot</strong> bait the protean first, so change the order of protean baits based on who gets the arrow on their head first. <br /> Once the AoE resolves on one group, it will pass on to the other group that did not get targeted first.</td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m1s/nine_lives_two_2.webm' /></td>
    </tr>

If you are still having issues with remembering which clones goes where, notice that the numbered waymarks are placed perfectly to where the clones might leap to. You can use those to make a mental note or write down something in chat like "2 out first" or "3 protean". If all else fails and you are not the MT, then you can try and follow your party, hoping that they can solve the memory check for you.

Once both clones are resolved, the boss will finish everything up with a <Raidwide>Bloody Scratch</Raidwide>. Mitigate this and heal, as the boss will soon jump back to the middle in order to start her next mechanic.
