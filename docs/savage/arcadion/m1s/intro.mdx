PF is split between [game8/Inumaru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1SBXo9tLfo) and [Nukemaru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Txqnv1oBHG4):
- PF is split between doing boss-relative and true north for the Nine Lives mechanics, double check the PF description!
  - Doing boss-relative also means clone-relative during [Nine Lives 2](/savage/m1s/nine_lives_2)!
  - Mana does clone-relative on top of boss-relative, so keep in mind that they do not follow game8 either for this specific part.
- Inumaru resolves both protean baits cardinally, while nukemaru does DPS intercardinal.
- Raining Cats is cheesed by using invulnerability from the tanks, with inumaru and nukemaru both having their own strategy for cheesing it:
  - This website will only cover the inumaru strategy of cheesing Raining Cats.
- Anything else is the same:
  - The one-tile strategy is used for Mouser.
  - Splintering Nails is fanned out TDH from left to right.
