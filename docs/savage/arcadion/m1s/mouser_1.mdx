Black Cat will now start attacking the tiles on the floor in the order that they glow in. The first attack will crack the tile while the second attack will completely shatter the tile, leaving a gaping hole that leads to death if anyone falls through it. There are a few things to keep in mind regarding this attack:
- The boss will attack all tiles at least once.
- There is always 2 undestroyed tiles in the center diagonally from each other.
- The boss will always attack the inner southeast tile first.

With the information at hand, position yourself at the inner southwest tile and look closely as to which tiles in the center gets targeted twice. Depending on which two tiles are getting destroyed, you only need to keep these two movements in mind.

    <tr>
        <th>Northwest/Southeast safe<br />Move to southeast and stay. You can jump over to northwest if you want.</th>
        <th>Northeast/Southwest safe<br />Move to southeast, then go back or go up to northeast.</th>

Once the coast is clear, the announcer will start repairing four tiles that has been destroyed by the previous attack. Once the holes has been filled up, the boss will now summon a copy of herself, which will do one of the following on the player that it targets:
- The copy cat pounds you to the ground, damaging the tile that the player is standing on.
- The copy cat uppercuts the player in the direction they're looking at, damaging the tile that they land on. The uppercut distance is rough around one tile wide.

Regardless of which attack the copy cat does, the copy will create a shockwave from where the player is that flies in all cardinal directions. Getting hit by this attack will yeet you straight off the arena, so avoid being in the same lane as the targeted player at all costs. You can see which attack the copy cat plans to do by looking at whether the copy is crouched down or standing up when its about to attack a player.

        <th>Pound</th>
        <th>Uppercut</th>

The copy cat will always use both pound and uppercut twice, and will target either all supports or all DPS. There are exactly four healthy tiles in the arena during this phase, so split up accordingly by giving melees the inner tiles and the outer tiles to the ranged. PF uses the one-tile strategy, which means that each player will resolve their uppercut inside a single tile. Resolving an uppercut inside a single tile can be done by angling yourself diagonally across your tile. If the mechanic is done properly, it should look something like the following:

Once everyone has survived the onslaught of uppercuts and pounding, the boss will cast <Tankbuster>Biscuit Maker</Tankbuster> on the player with the highest enmity. Tank swap or invuln this as necessary. Following after the tankbuster, the boss will cast <strong>Shockwave</strong> which does two things. First, it creates a purple knockback from the center that cannot be prevented through Arm's Length or Surecast. Second, it will also target an AoE on every player, forcing everyone to spread out as they resolve the knockback.

Right as the boss casts <strong>Shockwave</strong>, you will notice that all the outer tiles are getting repaired, with two of them at each side being repaired at a faster rate than the others. These fast repairing tiles is the key to your survival. Positoins yourselves to these tiles and let yourself get knocked back into those directions in order to prevent yourself from being thrown out of the arena. Immediately after resolving the knockback, spread out in order to avoid the AoE from clipping other players. Keep in mind that although you can yolo the knockback, it is preferred that group 1 goes west while group 2 goes east in order to avoid overcrowding a safe spot.
