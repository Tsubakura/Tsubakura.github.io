Black Cat will cast <strong>Mouser</strong> again to break the tiles in the arena. Nothing has changed since the last time, so dodge the attacks like you did last time in [Mouser 1](/savage/m1s/mouser_1).

## Overshadow and Splintering Nails

Once the arena is half repaired again, the boss will create a copycat again of herself, which will pound and uppercut your party again. The added twist in Mouser 2 is that the boss herself will now also cast an attack of her own while a player is resolving their uppercut/pound:
- <strong>Overshadow</strong>: A line stack that needs to be soaked by seven players.
- <strong>Splintering Nails</strong>: The boss will fire a protean each on one random tank, a random DPS and a random healer.

The line stack is self explanatory. <strong>Splintering Nails</strong> on the other hand requires the tanks, DPS and healers each to spread out as a group on a safe spot and as close to the boss as possible in order to not get hit by more than one protean. The easiest way to tell the safe spot is by using the player who is getting punched by the copy cat as the new north. From there, face the boss and spread out tank/DPS/healer from left to right with the safe space that is available.

    <tr>
        <th width='50%'>D3 is getting pounded in the corner, the party can use the whole row to fan out for Splintering Nails.</th>
        <th width='50%'>D2 is getting pounded on an inner tile, the groups needs to squeeze in and get as close to the boss as possible for Splintering Nails.</th>

Take into account that the boss will use <strong>Overshadow</strong> and <strong>Splintering Nails</strong>, but otherwise, the mechanic is mostly solved the same as [Mouser 1](/savage/m1s/mouser_1). The group that did not get targeted during Mouser 1 will now become the targets for the copy cat, which is something you can use to plan ahead.

After another onslaught of uppercuts and pounding, the boss will cast <Tankbuster>Biscuit Maker</Tankbuster> and follow it up with <strong>Shockwave</strong> again. Nothing has changed, so resolve those mechanic the same way as you did in [Mouser 1](/savage/m1s/mouser_1).
