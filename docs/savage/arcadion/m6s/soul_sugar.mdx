Sugar Riot will begin this phase by casting <strong>Soul Sugar</strong>, which will create a few flans on the map. This is immediately followed up by <strong>Live Painting</strong>, turning them into various creatures that you now have to deal with. This phase is brutal, almost on the level of an ultimate, so make sure that you understand what you're doing as one mistake from **anyone** can easily cascade into a wipe.

## The adds explained

Each of the adds have their own gimmick and understanding their mechanics is key to successfully understanding how you can pass the adds phase.

<table width='70%'>
    <tr>
        <td width='15%'><KittenAsset path='m6s/mu.png' /></td>
        <td><center><strong>Mu</strong></center><br />These innocent looking squirrels have a high amount of HP, but are not threatening at all and thus has the lowest target priority. However, they will cast a raidwide which will inflict heavy damage on your party if Sugar Riot casts <Raidwide>Ready Ore Not</Raidwide> while they are still alive. This is usually a wipe if multiple Mu's manage to get their cast off, and an obvious sign that your DPS or MT might be underperforming.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m6s/yan.png' /></td>
        <td><center><strong>Yan</strong></center><br />A deadly sheep that looks deceivingly cute. Its auto attacks easily deal up to 60-70k per hit, which means only a tank can effectively tank them for a prolonged time. This sheep will immediately enrage if a Mu gets too close to it, effectively turning auto attacks into instant deaths. The tanks must work together to make sure that the Yan and Mu remain separated from each other.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m6s/gimme_cat.png' /></td>
        <td><center><strong>Gimme Cat</strong></center><br />Drains all your LB gauge upon spawning. This cat will then annoy your party by jumping randomly around the arena, occasionally jumping on a random party member to cast a small AoE. If this cat is not defeated yet by the third time an AoE is cast, then this cat will enrage and summon a meteor that wipes the party on the spot. The cat is very mobile, so it is mainly the responsibility of the ranged players to take them out.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m6s/feather_ray.png' /></td>
        <td><center><strong>Feather Ray</strong></center><br />This manta ray will tether to the first player that attacks it. Once tethered to a player, the ray will fire <strong>Water III</strong> in intervals against the target, which will leave behind a puddle that becomes impassable. The spell will also inflict a temporary vulnerability debuff that makes any attack fatal, auto attacks included, which means the tanks must avoid getting hit by them at all costs.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m6s/jabberwock.png' /></td>
        <td><center><strong>Jabberwock</strong></center><br />The jabberwock will target a random healer, signaled by an arrow marker above the healer's head, and bind the healer in place. Once its prey is stuck in place, it will then march, slowly but menacingly, towards its target, killing the healer instantly if it successfully reaches him/her. The bind itself also inflicts quite some damage on the healer, so make sure that you've healed yourself up beforehand.<br /><br /> Unlike all the other adds, the jabberwock can be stunned using <strong>Low Blow</strong> and <strong>Legsweep</strong>.</td>

This mechanic has four waves in total and this page tries to break it down as much as it can in order for you to successfully understand what you need to be prioritizing on and how you can persevere this phase.

## Wave 1

<table>
    <tr>
        <td width='40%'><KittenAsset path='m6s/adds_wave1.png' /></td>
        <td>
            Main objectives for wave 1:
            <ul>
                <li>Eliminate both the Yan and Gimme Cat.</li>
                <li>MT establishes aggro on the Mu and keeps them away from the Yan.</li>
                <li>ST establishes aggro on the Yan and keeps it west, until it is defeated.</li>
                <li>Weaken the Mu's as much as you can.</li>
            </ul>
            Bonus:
            <ul>
                <li>Use caster LB2 to deal damage before the Gimme Cat steals all your LB away from you.</li>
                <li>Bait the Gimme Cat on top of the Yan to maximize AoE damage.</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan='2'><center>Time limit until the 2nd wave spawns: 30 seconds</center></td>
    </tr>
</table>

Immediately at the first wave, there is a tech that your caster DPS can utilize. If your caster uses his/her LB2 immediately after Sugar Riot finishes casting <strong>Live Painting</strong>, then you can inflict extra damage onto the adds. Your LB gauge will be stolen by the cat regardless, so while not necessary, it is considered lost damage if you fail to utilize this.

Regardless of whether your party uses LB or not, the first wave is pretty straightforward. The ranged players will eliminate the Gimme Cat as soon as they can, while the melee DPS will focus fire on the Yan. Once the Gimme Cat is eliminated, the ranged should help out in eliminating the Yan.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Melee PoV</th>
        <th>Ranged PoV</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m6s/adds_wave1_melee.webm' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m6s/adds_wave1_ranged.webm' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

During wave 1, you have the option to commit your 2 minute burst. However, if you notice that the DPS is lacking in the latter waves, then it is recommended that you save your 2 minutes for the second wave of adds instead. Delaying the burst window is by far the most popular choice in PF, but verify this with your party if there happens to be any questions surrounding it.

By the end of wave 1, both the Yan and Gimme Cat should be eliminated. The MT should be on standby around south along with the two Mu. If the ST wants to contribute to the damage, then make sure that their stance is off for the remainder of wave 1 and 2! The duty of the ST is to keep the sheeps busy, so it becomes problematic if the ST accidentally aggroes a squirrel.

## Wave 2

<table>
    <tr>
        <td width='40%'><KittenAsset path='m6s/adds_wave2.png' /></td>
        <td>
            Main objectives for wave 2:
            <ul>
                <li>D3 establishes tether on the northwest Feather Ray.</li>
                <li>H2 establishes tether on the northeast Feather Ray.</li>
                <li>Eliminate both Feather Rays.</li>
                <li>MT establishes aggro on the Mu, after which he/she drags the packs to the Feather Rays to maximize cleave damage.</li>
                <li>The Mu's may not be aggroed to the ST, make sure your stance is off!</li>
                <li>Weaken the Mu's as much as you can.</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan='2'><center>Time limit until the 3rd wave spawns: 20 seconds</center></td>
    </tr>
</table>

The D3 and H2 should immediately attack their rays once they become targetable and go to their respective corners at north for the puddle drops. This point can't be stressed enough, but everyone else should not mindlessly attack the Feather Rays. This is easily a common cause of a wipe, whether it be caused by an unfortunate accident or from the lack of discipline.

<KittenAsset path='m6s/adds_wave2_ray_path.png' wrapper='div' width='40%' />

Upon confirming that the tethers are in place, the MT should now drag all the adds to the northeast Feather Ray. The rest of the party, which is now the death squad, are to use their 2 minute burst right here to eliminate the ray as fast as they can while also inflicting maximum damage on the squirrels that are clumped together around the ray. Inflict as much cleave damage as you can while targeting the key targets! Once the first ray is down, the MT can drag the pack to the 2nd ray and repeat the process. 

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Melee DPS PoV</th>
        <th>D3 PoV</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m6s/adds_wave2_melee.webm' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m6s/adds_wave2_ranged.webm' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

As D3, you do not need to stay at the wall either, as long as you don't drop a puddle anywhere in the middle. For reference, you can use the enemy list on your HUD to determine when the rays are casting <strong>Water III</strong>, which is your cue to get back to the wall.

<KittenAsset path='m6s/adds_wave2_end.png' wrapper='div' width='40%' />


## Wave 3

<table>
    <tr>
        <td width='40%'><KittenAsset path='m6s/adds_wave2.png' /></td>
        <td>
            Main objectives for wave 3:
            <ul>
                <li>Eliminate the Jabberwock, preferably before it kills the healer.</li>
                <li>Eliminate all the Mu's before they get their raidwide off.</li>
                <li>Eliminate the Gimme Cat after eliminating all the squirrels.</li>
                <li>ST establishes aggro (don't forget your tank stance!!) on the Yan and keeps it northeast, preferably inside the healing range.</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan='2'><center>Time limit until <Raidwide>Ready Ore Not</Raidwide>: 27 seconds<br />Time limit until the 4th wave spawns: 40 seconds</center></td>
    </tr>
</table>

Once the 3rd wave spawns, the ST should immediately re-enable his/her stance and head over to north to provoke the Yan. The healer that gets targeted by Jabberwock should drop whatever he/she is doing and move all the way to the southeast corner of the map. The rest of the DPS should AoE down the squirrels, until Jabberwock becomes targetable, after which **everyone** should be focus firing on it until it is defeated. Tanks and melee DPSes should take turns to use their stun abilities to buy more time for their party, using the following order: MT > D1 > D2. 

<KittenAsset path='m6s/adds_wave3_starting.png' wrapper='div' width='40%' />

When the Jabberwock is around halfway towards the healer, Sugar Riot will cast her first instance of <Raidwide>Ready Ore Not</Raidwide>, which is a strong raidwide that needs to be mitigated. However, what this raidwide also does is trigger the enrage condition for the Mu, which means you are now in a race against time to eliminate both the Jabberwock and Mu's before your party gets wiped.

<KittenAsset path='m6s/adds_wave3_jabberwock.webm' wrapper='div' />

Hopefully, your party has been diligently cleaving the squirrels to the point that they are weak enough now to be easily defeated. Once again, maximize your cleave damage as much as you can. If your AoE is not a gain, then use your single target attacks to eliminate the Jabberwock. 

<KittenAsset path='m6s/adds_wave3_cat.webm' wrapper='div' />

**Absolutely do not forget the cat**, which is another cause of wipes due to players thinking they're home free after defeating the squirrels. While it will not outright cause a wipe, it will cause an inconvenience if the cat isn't eliminated before the 4th wave spawns in. So if there are no other priority targets left, then you should contribute to hunting down the cat.

<KittenAsset path='m6s/adds_wave3_end.png' wrapper='div' width='40%' />

Once the 4th wave is about to spawn in, the ST should migrate further up north.


## Wave 4

<table>
    <tr>
        <td width='40%'><KittenAsset path='m6s/adds_wave4.png' /></td>
        <td>
            Main objectives for wave 4:
            <ul>
                <li>MT establishes aggro on the Mu and keeps them south, away from the Yan.</li>
                <li>ST provokes the 2nd Yan and keeps both Yan up north, until all Mu's are defeated.</li>
                <li>D3 establishes tether on the southwest Feather Ray.</li>
                <li>D4 establishes tether on the southeast Feather Ray.</li>
                <li>Eliminate the Jabberwock, preferably before it kills the healer.</li>
                <li>Eliminate Gimme Cat</li>
                <li>Eliminate both Feather Rays.</li>
                <li>Eliminate all Mu's.</li>
                <li>Eliminate all Yans.</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan='2'><center>Time limit until <Raidwide>Ready Ore Not</Raidwide>: 70 seconds<br />Time limit until enrage: 98 seconds</center></td>
    </tr>
</table>

The whole zoo has appeared for the final wave. The tanks should establish enmity on their assigned targets, while D3 and D4 attacks their assigned Feather Rays for the puddle baits. The healer selected by Jabberwock should move all the way south at the wall. 

During this phase, the ST will be constantly attacked by two Yans (roughly 120k damage total), so all the supports must step up their game and help out this poor tank. As for the ST, cycle through your mitigations like how you wall to wall in dungeons, and don't be afraid to use your invulnerability just to survive.
