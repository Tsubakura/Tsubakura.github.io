Pull Sugar Riot up north to minimize melee downtime, as she will teleport up north soon once again for her <strong>Sugarscape</strong>. While this phase is by far easier than the adds phase, any mistakes can still easily cascade into a wipe, so do be careful and respect the mechanics.

## Sugarscape

Sugar Riot will randomly use one of the attacks that was used in normal mode, but will this time use <strong>Double Style</strong> to combine this attack with the arrow line AoEs, which will limit the safe tiles the party can use to resolve their mechanics. Luckily, there only exists two patterns for the arrows, which limits the variables that you have to deal with.

Similarly to normal mode, touching water is fatal if you get electrocuted, but you must be standing in water if the boss uses a fire attack. Identify whether the boss uses lightning or fire, and adjust accordingly to your correct positions. Keep in mind that you will be forced to go downtime as melee if you get the lightning pattern, but respect the mechanic nonetheless.

## Thunderstorm

Sugar Riot unfortunately does not like how the scenery is peaceful like this. To fix the issue, she casts <strong>Layer</strong> and creates a thunderstorm inside the painting. The river is now dangerous to touch due to it becoming muddy and the landscape is now riddled with random lightning strikes, which you unfortunately, have to deal with now.

Immediately head over to the northern bridge, because a baited lightning will strike exactly where you are, which is vaguely telegraphed by your screen flashing purple for a moment. You might recognize this as the infamous twister from UCOB or the Akh Rai mechanic from E8S/FRU. Upon seeing your screen flash, that is your cue to immediately run from where you're standing, away from the giant thundercloud that is now looming above your heads. The AoE of the thundercloud is gigantic, so do keep your distance from it.
