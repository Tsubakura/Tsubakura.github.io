Pull Sugar Riot up north to minimize melee downtime, as she will teleport up north soon once again for her <strong>Sugarscape</strong>. While this phase is by far easier than the adds phase, any mistakes can still easily cascade into a wipe, so do be careful and respect the mechanics.

## Sugarscape

Sugar Riot will randomly use one of the attacks that was used in normal mode, but will this time use <strong>Double Style</strong> to combine this attack with the arrow line AoEs, which will limit the safe tiles the party can use to resolve their mechanics. Luckily, there only exists two patterns for the arrows, which limits the variables that you have to deal with.

Similarly to normal mode, touching water is fatal if you get electrocuted, but you must be standing in water if the boss uses a fire attack. Identify whether the boss uses lightning or fire, and adjust accordingly to your correct positions. Keep in mind that you will be forced to go downtime as melee if you get the lightning pattern, but respect the mechanic nonetheless.

## Thunderstorm

Sugar Riot unfortunately does not like how the scenery is peaceful like this. To fix the issue, she casts <strong>Layer</strong> and creates a thunderstorm inside the painting. The river is now dangerous to touch due to it becoming muddy and the landscape is now riddled with random lightning strikes which you, unfortunately, have to deal with now.

Immediately head over to the northern bridge, because a baited lightning will strike exactly where you are, which is vaguely telegraphed by your screen flashing purple for a moment. You might recognize this as the infamous twister from UCOB or the Akh Rai mechanic from E8S/FRU. Upon seeing your screen flash, that is your cue to immediately run from where you're standing, away from the giant thundercloud that is now looming above your heads. The AoE of the thundercloud is gigantic, so do keep your distance from it.

After dodging the initial lightning strike, the thundercloud will now randomly pick 1 support and 1 DPS for a lightning strike, signaled by a purple arrow above the player's head. This lightning strike will electrocute the whole island the player is standing on, so there can only be one player per island.

The giant thundercloud occupies one island, so the support and DPS need to split up among the remaining two islands to safely soak the lightning without killing each other. Using the thundercloud as the new north, the support should go west while the DPS go east. The rest of the party can safely stand on the wooden bridge that is opposite of the thundercloud, which doesn't seem to transmit electricity for whatever reason.

Just like normal mode, the thundercloud will move to a random island. Identify which way the cloud is going and go either clockwise or counterclockwise. Unless there were deaths, each player will only get selected once for the lightning, so that should also give you some anticipation whether it is your turn or not.

Once you're done with the thundercloud, Sugar Riot will wrap it up with <strong>Pudding Party</strong>, which is a multi-hit stack marker. Your 2 minute should be back up around this moment if you have delayed your burst during the adds phase, so feel free to burst once you see the stack marker appear.
