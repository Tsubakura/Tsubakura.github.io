Honey B. Lovely now becomes more notably aggressive in her tone as you're skillfully dodging all her attacks. She attempts to tankbuster you one last time with either <Tankbuster>Stinging Slash</Tankbuster> or <Tankbuster>Killer Sting</Tankbuster>, but once that doesn't work, she shows you her true nature by casting <Raidwide>Rotten Heart</Raidwide>. Healers be prepared, because this is a strong raidwide and all the upcoming mechanics are only strong raidwides at this point. The difficulty of this mechanic depends on how poorly your party has been performing during the live stage mechanics. The more times your party became charmed, the more painful the attacks will be.

## Rotten Heart

Upon entering her rotten heart stage, every player will now get assigned a new debuff.

If a player with A touches someone with B, then the debuff will be resolved while also simultaneously causing a raidwide. The timers for each debuff pairs can either be 11, 27, 43 or above a minute. Letting the timer run out instead will cause the player to explode instead, likely wiping the party because the partner will also explode at the same time.</td>

Go to your clockspot, away from the boss, and check your debuff timers! Your goal in this phase is to resolve all debuff stacks without outright killing the party, while dealing with the boss's raidwide whenever she uses <Raidwide>Call Me Honey</Raidwide>. This phase is essentially a mitigation/heal check, so spread your mitigations around and keep the following in mind to easily resolve this mechanic:
- Make absolutely sure the first pair (11s) is resolved before the debuff hits 4 seconds, or the party will wipe from the incoming <Raidwide>Call Me Honey</Raidwide> due to the magic vulnerability.
- Do not go to middle if you either see a magic vulnerability or if the party's HP is really low.
- Go to middle if it is your turn to resolve the Beeloved Venom. Once its resolved, go back to your clockspot.

<br /><br />
The Beeloved Venom mechanic is essentially a soft enrage. If the boss is still not defeated after all the debuff stacks are resolved, then the boss will cast one final <Raidwide>Call Me Honey</Raidwide> before following this up with <Enrage>Sheer Heart Attack</Enrage>, wiping the party on the spot.
