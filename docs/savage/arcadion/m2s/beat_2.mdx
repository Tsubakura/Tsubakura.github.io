Honey B. Lovely casts <Raidwide>Honey B. Live: 2nd Beat</Raidwide>, transitioning into the live stage again. Once the raidwide is cast, four players will now have 1 heart, while four other players have 0 heart.

<KittenAsset path='m2s/transition_beat_2.gif' />

Once you've entered her live stage again, the boss will cast either <strong>Spread Love</strong> or <strong>Drop of Love</strong>. These work exactly like <strong>Splash of Venom</strong> or <strong>Drop of Venom</strong> with the added effect of inflicting a heart, so make a mental note as to whether its spread or partner stack, as this mechanic will resolve later.

## Love Me Tender

After she stores her attack, the boss will follow it up with <strong>Love Me Tender</strong>, which does the following:
- One random DPS and one random support with no hearts will get a stack marker, with each dealing 4 hearts worth of damage.
  - The same two players who gets the stack marker will now also drop baited AoE puddles on the ground, which the players need to dodge. There are five baited AoE puddles in total.
- One random DPS and one random support with 1 heart stack will receive a targeted AoE.
- Two towers will spawn at opposites sides, which can either at north/south, or west/east.
  - These need to be soaked by players with 1 hearts that did not get any AoE.

Your goal is to resolve all the above mechanics while making sure that everyone does not ever get 3 hearts or more. If done correctly, everyone should have two hearts by the end of this mechanic. The current popular strategy is nukemaru, but there also exists a braindead way of resolving this mechanic. Both are easy to execute, so decide with the party how you want to resolve this.

The nukemaru strategy has the 0 hearts bait from center to north, after which the pairs split off in order to resolve both stacks as pairs. Nukemaru intends players to take the downtime in order to safely resolve the mechanic, so do be careful if you intend to uptime the boss.

<TabItem value="Braindead" label="Braindead (NA)">

This strategy abuses the fact that the stack markers doesn't inflict any magic vulnerabilities, which means you can stack both stack markers together in order to resolve the mechanic. This is one of the few instances where you can stack multiple stack markers together without consequences. Uptime is guaranteed.

Upon resolving all the mechanics, the boss will now use either <strong>Tempting Twist</strong> or <strong>Honey Beeline</strong> to resolve the attack that was stored at the beginning of this live phase. Dodge appropriately whether its spread or drop, and quickly heal up as the boss will follow it up immediately with <Raidwide>Honey B. Finale</Raidwide>.
