Honey B. Lovely casts <Raidwide>Honey B. Live: 3rd Beat</Raidwide>, transitioning into the live stage again for the third time.

This time, nobody will get any hearts, but they will be greeted with a new debuff instead:
- One role group (all supports or all dps) will get a Poison 'n' Pop debuff with a 25 second timer, which will be referred to as the short timer.
- The other group will be assigned a Poison 'n' Pop debuff with a 45 second timer, which will be referred to as the long timer.

        <td><center><strong>Poison 'n' Pop</strong></center>Known as defamation, this debuff will cause a gigantic AoE explosion around you once the timer hits zero. The AoE is big enough to cover the whole arena and it inflicts magic vulnerability on hit, so do not try to greed this and make sure you're on the edge of the arena when your timer is running out.<br /><br />The timers for the defamation are role based, so everyone in the same role group starts with the same time.</td>

Upon entering the live phase, the boss once again casts <strong>Spread Love</strong> or <strong>Drop of Love</strong>. After storing her attack, she will now cast either <strong>Outerstage Combo</strong> or <strong>Centerstage Combo</strong> and every time she finishes her combo, she follows it up by summoning four towers that each needs to be soaked by a player. This requires a bit of coordination, because you now have a defamation debuff to worry about which interferes with the tower soaking.

<table width='80%'>
    <tr>
        <td width='50%'>Resolve either <strong>Outerstage Combo</strong> or <strong>Centerstage Combo</strong>, depending on which one the boss uses first. If the boss uses outerstage first, then you can expect centerstage on the second set.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Upon resolving the combo attack, four towers will now spawn. Ignore those towers, because the players with the short timer is about to explode. Everyone with a long timer should stack dead center under the boss, while each player with a short timer should now run out to the intercardinal edge of their clockspot to resolve the defamation. In this example, the supports have the short timer.</td>

After the mechanic is resolved, the boss will cast her <strong>Tempting Twist</strong> or <strong>Honey Beeline</strong> to resolve the stored attack, followed by <Raidwide>Honey B. Finale</Raidwide>.
