Upon exiting the live stage, the boss will now either cast <Tankbuster>Stinging Slash</Tankbuster> or <Tankbuster>Killer Sting</Tankbuster>. Deal with the tankbuster as necesasry and prepare for the most infamous mechanic in this fight.

## Alarm Pheromones

The boss will summon bees all around the arena that will each target a random player and then dash in a straight line after some moments. The bees spawn are random and the player it targets is also random. Although there exists the mariokart strategy that makes it easier for the party to bait the bees around, there exists no strategy that is completely free.

    <tr>
        <td width='60%'>As MT, immediately pull the boss to the north once Honey B. Live: 1st Beat resolves. The rest of the group, wait until the tankbusters are resolved and stack together with the MT at north. This step is important, because if everyone spreads out, then the bee's line of fires will become random.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Identify the first bee that targets you and rotate CW or CCW as necessary. The first bee is spawning northeast and is going to dash west, so you should rotate counterclockwise once you see at least 3 bees has spawned. <br /><br />Now here comes the tricky part. You want to maintain this CW/CCW movement by making small movements at a time, which helps with baiting at least 3-4 bees into one location. If your direct path in front of you has incoming bees, then you need to shift between outer edge, the inner edge or possibly even cut through center. The arrows on your right shows an example of how your movement could end up be if you are rotating counterclockwise. For clockwise rotation, simply mirror the image. <br /><br />While this movement can help with making the dodges easier, you are still required to use your eyes to see if you're not walking straight into a bee's line of fire.</td>

Keep in mind that doing a full mariokart is not the only way of passing this mechanic, as it is perfectly possible to just yolo dodge everything. Not everyone might follow the same plan, so fall back to using your eyes if it comes to that as seen in an example below.
