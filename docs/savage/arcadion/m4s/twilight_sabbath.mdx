Once you're done with the mini tutorial, Wicked Thunder will use <Raidwide>Azure Thunder</Raidwide> to shrink the arena down. Mitigate the raidwide and prepare for the first of the sabbath mechanics, which is <strong>Twilight Sabbath</strong>.

## Twilight Sabbath

Once the arena has been shrunk down into a circle, the boss will summon four clones that will slowly descend onto the arena. These are the same clones you saw in normal mode, the clones that will do a <strong>Sidewise Spark</strong> once they appear. First, stack in the middle because the boss will cast <strong>Wicked Fire</strong>, which will drop a giant AoE puddle on all players.

Notice how two clones descend faster than the other two? Identify where these two clones are cleaving and move to the safe quadrant, as their sideroom cleaves will only leave one quadrant safe. If you have trouble with trying to identify the safe spot quickly, notice that the arms of the clones already point in a certain direction before you see the actual lightning spark. You can use this early tell to identify early as to which way the clones intend to cleave. If necessary, you can also pop sprint.

After dodging one pair, you need to turn around and identify immediately how the other last pair of clones intend to cleave. This is combined with a <strong>Wicked Special</strong>, so get to the center or to the sides, depending on which one she attacks you with. Overally, this is not a hard mechanic, but your reactions need to be quick in order to properly dodge all the attacks.
