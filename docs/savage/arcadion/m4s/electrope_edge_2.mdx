Wicked Thunder casts <strong>Electrope Edge</strong> again, but this time, instead of summoning cubes that are placed on the field, you are now the cube! At the same time, the arena tiles is now expanded to 5x5 for the cube mechanics.

        <td><center><strong>Electrical Condenser</strong></center><br />You are now a cube! When the timer hits zero, you will discharge electricity on the tiles around you. The size of your discharge depends on how many attacks you have received from the boss, including the ones you take from failing to do the mechanics properly. If you somehow manage to accumulate 4 charges instead, then you will explode when the timer runs out, wiping the party. <br /><br />Each role group always has two players with a 42s timer and two players with a 22s timer.</td>

Immediately spread out to your clockspot around the boss, because the boss will cast <strong>Witchgleam</strong> and start zapping each player at random. Start counting how many times you have zapped, because this will be important for the next mechanic. Make sure to remember your number as forgetting your number will likely cause a wipe in the next mechanic.

The players with 22s will always be either zapped twice or three times, whereas players with 42s will only be zapped once or twice. Players with a 42s debuff timer can manually increase their own count by +1 and treat those as two and three, because you will inevitably get hit in a stack/spread mechanic which occurs later.

## Lightning Cage 

The boss will now cast <strong>Lightning Cage</strong>, which will zap tiles on the floors in a certain pattern. At the same time, the players who started with 22s has to resolve their debuff now without their attack hitting any other players. Hopefully you've remembered your number of charges during the counting exercise!

The lightning pattern of the <strong>Lightning Cage</strong> is always the same, so immediately identify the cardinal safe spot in order to identify the new south. Once you have identified the new south, the 2 supports take the west spots while the DPS takes the east spots.

        <th colspan='2'>Safe spot is at D<br />B is the new north</th>

After resolving the <strong>Lightning Cage</strong>, the boss will face north and cast <strong>Sidewise Spark</strong> again with the combined spread/stack mechanics that accompanies it. The spread is straightforward, because you literally have half the arena to spread your party out on. The two-man stack however, is a bit more tricky because the boss will only target the players who still has unresolved electrical condenser debuff on them. You want to avoid a pair eating a double orb, so for this specific scenario, you must pair a player with the debuff with someone who does not have the debuff.

Hopefully you still remember your charges, because this becomes relevant in case the boss uses a two-man stack version of the <strong>Sidewise Spark</strong>. If you still have the electrical condenser debuff, then remember to increment your own count by +1. This mechanic uses true north, so pay attention to where the north is when positioning yourself for the mechanic.

        <th>Sidewise Spark (West safe)<br />Spread</th>
        <th>Sidewise Spark (East safe)<br />Spread</th>

After resolving the spread/stack mechanic, the boss will summon another <strong>Lightning Cage</strong>. This time, the players who started with a 42s timer must now resolve their cube debuffs.

<table width='50%'>
    <tr>
        <th colspan='2'>Safe spot is at B<br />D is new north</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>

This mechanic is essentialy a very fast paced counting exercise and a memory check. If you are having trouble getting to the safe square, then consider using sprint to get to your corner faster.
