Most parties should be able to defeat the boss at this point, but if not, then you will have to deal with her soft enrage mechanic. The boss declares "no quarter" here, so fight like your life depends on it because she truly intends to kill you.

## Sword Quiver

The boss will swipe the arena with lines that will expand and explode, similarly to the laser lines you've seen at the start of this fight. The first three swipes are always the same, which forms a star shape on the arena. 

<table width='50%'>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m4s/sword_quiver_neutral.png' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

Now, the 4th swipe will either be the top, the middle or the bottom. This is immediately followed up by a two-man stack attack, so immediately move to the safespots that remains after the 4th slash. The boss will do this three times in total.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Top unsafe</th>
        <th>Middle unsafe</th>
        <th>Bottom unsafe</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m4s/sword_quiver_top.png' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m4s/sword_quiver_middle.png' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m4s/sword_quiver_bottom.png' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

Keep in mind that raidwide damage is dealt every time the boss swipes the arena with lines, so heal and mitigate like your life depends on it. You do not want to die to lack of heals or mitigation after having passed <strong>Sunrise Sabbath</strong>.

If the boss has not been defeated yet at this point after she has cast <strong>Sword Quiver</strong> three times, then she will cast <Enrage>Wicked Thunder</Enrage>, which will wipe the party on the spot.
