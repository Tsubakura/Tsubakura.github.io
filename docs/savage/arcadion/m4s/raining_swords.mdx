Wicked Thunder will start off by casting <strong>Aetherial Conversion</strong> to store her attack. Remember the order in which the tentacles strike, as her <strong>Tail Thrust</strong> will only occur at the end of this major mechanic.

Immediately split off between west and east towards your tower spots, because the boss will soon cast <strong>Flame Slash</strong> to destroy the middle two columns and this is immediately followed it up with <strong>Raining Swords</strong>. The towers spawn really fast, so preposition as soon as you can once the boss is done storing her attack.

Do not wait until the boss starts casting <strong>Raining Swords</strong> as the towers are really fast, you have all the time in the world to preposition while she is casting <strong>Flame Slash</strong>.

## Chain Lightning

The boss will use <strong>Chain Lightning</strong> to zap three random swords on one side. The lightning will then start jumping between the swords on each sides, signaling which swords the lightning will strike and making it unsafe to stand under that specific sword. The lightning will jump between each sides until the swords on each sides have been zapped 4 times each. There's always one safe spot during each set and your goal as a party is to remember the order in which the lightning travel in order to prevent yourself from getting zapped.

Some things to keep in mind regarding this mechanic...
- You can assign a number to the swords from top to bottom in order to help yourself remember.
- Melee players are temporarily forced to disengage if the 4th sword is the safe spot, greed at your own risk.
- Do not gapclose if you're on the 4th sword, because you will dash into the hole in the middle if you do and fall to your death.
- All four safe spots must be unique, which means you will never stand under the same sword twice during this mechanic.
  - If you know the first three safe spots, then you can infer the last one using this logic.
  - Similarly, you know you messed up if you count the same safe spot twice while trying to memorize it.
- And finally, if you have issues memorizing the order, then you can always follow the party and hope they can do it correctly.

The boss will immediately use <strong>Tail Thrust</strong> once the arena has been repaired. Resolve the knockbacks if its blue, or dodge them if its red.
