Wicked Thunder realizes she can't beat you as she is now, so she resorts to desperate measures by using <strong>Electrope Transplant</strong>, initiating her transformation sequence.

While she is transforming, you will have to deal with the attacks that are flying towards you. These are always telegraphed proteans that alternate between safe spots, which happens 7 times per set.
- On the 5th wave, she will throw an electric orb AoE at either all supports or all DPS, which gives them an elemental debuff.
- On the 6th wave, she will fire a wild charge laser on all the players that she has attacked with the electric orb.
  - The player with the debuff cannot take the wild charge headon, so they must get behind their partner to not die from the laser.

During this transition phase, keep in mind that south is the new north, so adjust accordingly to your new positions. Assuming everything goes well, your movement should look something like the following below.

Wicked Thunder will repeat this attack twice. There is a short pause in between, so the healers has the time to get close to heal up before the boss repeats the same attack again.

After dodging two sets of the same attack, the boss will enlarge and grow titan-sized, dealing raidwide damage while she is stomping around. Mitigate and immediately head to south, because the platform you're on will be destroyed soon, sending everyone flying as a result. Aim yourself towards the far southern platform by aligning yourself properly. If you're not aligned properly on the southern side, then you will be yeeted into the void instead.
