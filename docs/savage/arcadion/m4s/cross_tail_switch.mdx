Take your time to heal up and/or revive anyone who happen to be yeeted into the void instead. The boss will teleport to you shortly, initiating the 2nd phase of this fight. Take note that her auto attacks hits like a truck during this phase, so all supports should actively help the MT with mitigations or heals. Consider using your mitigations to mitigate auto attacks instead, as there aren't many tankbusters during this phase.

## Exaflares

After giving you a short break, the boss will cast <Raidwide>Cross Tail Switch</Raidwide>, which is a multi-hitting raidwide attack that deals randomly from 150k to 300k damage per hit. This attack hits up to 9 times, so unless your healers has told you not to, one of the tanks should LB this to survive the onslaught. Account for the 1 second delay in activation and time the LB as perfect as you can to cover as many hits as you can. For reference, you can press LB once the cast bar hits the letter S on the sword Switch.

Once you've survived the initial barrage, the arena will be littered with exaflares. Ignore the exaflares on the middle two columns. The middle column exaflares are never safe and only serves to distract you from the actual threat. Split up your light party groups between west and east, because the boss will cast <strong>Wicked Blaze</strong>, which is a multi-hit stack marker.

Assuming nobody has fallen off the platform, the image above should be the starting position for everyone in the party. To determine the safe spot on your side, you have to look at the other side of the arena and identify which exaflares are coming towards you. There are only three possible movements for you to consider when solving the exaflares:
- Go down a bit (down 1)
- Go up a bit (up 1)
- Go all the way to the top (up 2)

The exaflares are quite fast, but you should have enough time to walk all the way to the top without resorting to sprint. The most important is that you don't walk off the edge, especially if you're a healer, because that would cause a wipe.
