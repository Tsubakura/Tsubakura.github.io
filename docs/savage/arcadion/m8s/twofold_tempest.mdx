Once your party has survived the <strong>Elemental Purge</strong>, the Howling Blade will cast <strong>Prowling Gale</strong> to summon a tower on each island, which needs to be soaked by two people each.

This sets up the position for what is the prelude to the next major mechanic: <strong>Twofold Tempest</strong>. 

## Twofold Tempest

The core of this mechanic is divided in two parts that happen simultaneously: The tether that shoots slowly expanding force fields and a proximity attack from the boss himself that cleaves the whole platform. Both of these attacks happen at the same time and up to four times.

A player cannot take both of them at the same time. Because each of these attacks also inflict a magical vulnerability, you will need to split the responsibilities in a way that allows each player to soak both of the attack once while leaving enough grace period inbetween for the magical vulnerability to expire.

If this sounds familiar to you, then you are correct, because this is the same concept used in Program Loop for TOP and the rat boss in Another Mount Rokkon.

    <tr>
        <td rowspan='4' colspan='6' width='60%'>Two things will happen: First, you have to soak the tower with your partner, so you cannot do anything until that is resolved first. Second, the boss will use <strong>Rise of the Howling Wind</strong> to turn all the teleporters red. What this does is it effectively increases the cooldown debuff of the teleporters by 7, which means you cannot just teleport back if you accidentally teleported to the wrong island.<br /><br />Now, the first tether will appear on a random player, but ideally, you want the tether to start either the MT or the ST island. There are two approaches to this for the DPS players: The first approach, which is the game8 approach, is to simply run to the MT/ST island immediately as the tower resolves and before the teleporter turns red. Once you've identified that the tether has spawned, you can simply go back to your own island and do your thing.<br /><br />The second approach is to just stay on your own island and manually pass the tether to the MT/ST island if you happen to get it. The long teleporter cooldown is irrelevant in this case, because you wont be baiting the proximity anytime soon if you had to pass the tether, which means there's no rush to get back to your own island. Obviously, while easier to execute, this is not PF approved because they assume you follow game8, so use at your own risk.</td>

With the starting positions sorted out, you can now use the below diagram to solve the mechanic, going from left to right or right to left, depending on where the tether has started. Keep in mind, both the tether and the proximity attack from the boss are two-man **enumerations**! If any of the attacks are soaked alone, then the player will instantly die no matter how many mitigation the player has.

Some things to keep in mind:
- The attacks are not fatal without mitigations, but having mitigations will help reduce the required healing to soak both attacks.
- You can intercept the tether by standing in front of the teleporter, which allows you to instantly grab it as soon as the other player teleports to your platform.
- Try and respect the tether mechanic. If the wind dome ends up covering the teleporters, then it will likely cause a wipe.
- If you trust your melee partner, then you can leave the tether transport to him/her. Otherwise, go together to avoid any potential tether memes.
