Game8 uses [Nuke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pqxs9VBKn74)[maru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnFCYfJ-HaM) as base, while incorporating some other strategies that were prevalent in early weeks:
- **Stonefang** is done using a fixed position, which originated from [Idyll (Kanatan)](http://kanatan.info/archives/39556775.html).
  - Windfang is color coded partners.
- **Millennial Decay** is done using [IQ6000](https://x.com/yukiusa_14/status/1908541388968558841).
- While JP solves Beckon Moonlight using half the room, the EN PFs prefer the [quad strategy](https://raidplan.io/plan/WFsLBku1C9Iyxneu) instead.
- The game8 lineup for Ultraviolent Ray is TRMH, not to be confused with THRM which originated from [Toxic Friends Raidplan](https://raidplan.io/plan/9M-1G-mmOaaroDOG).
- At the start of **Twofold Tempest**, the DPS are to rush to the support island before the teleporters turn red in order to prevent the tether from starting in the middle.
  - This is not a requirement obviously, but this is part of the game8 strategy and thus the preferred approach by the JP players.
- **Lone Wolf's Lament** is resolved using [Alice's strat](https://x.com/Arieltemp/status/1908647291432690050/photo/2), which is basically how woops/MrHappy resolved it in week 1.
- The last **Ultraviolent Ray** is infamous for being chaotic and having many different strats in an attempt to make it easier to coordinate:
  - EN prefers [Rinon UV4](https://youtu.be/CPpfqs0ysuM?si=1Yic5zTVx5-_mIQY&t=750) while JP prefers you to just try and get back to your Quake III islands.
    - At the end of the day, none of the strategies circulating actually addresses the actual issue of this chaotic last **Ultraviolent Ray**, so use your common sense instead and eyeball it.
- **Howling Eight** is done 81128, which means party stack > MT invuln > ST invuln > both tanks > party stack, in that order:
  - **Howling Eight** is rotated counterclockwise (go right facing boss).
    - Make sure that everyone is on the same wavelength here, you absolutely do not want someone to teleport the wrong way and cause a tower to spawn at the other side of the map.

Other things to keep in mind:
- This fight has two phases with a transition cutscene inbetween, but there are no checkpoints in between.
- There are two <Tankbuster>Great Divide</Tankbuster> during phase 1, which is commonly cheesed through invuln.
  - Decide amongst the tanks who is going to invulns first, just keep in mind that this attack targets the player with the highest aggro.
    - As WAR, you want to be invulning the first <Tankbuster>Great Divide</Tankbuster> in order for your invuln to be back up for the first <Tankbuster>Twinbite</Tankbuster> in P2.
    - If you can't decide and there's no WAR, then MT first and ST second always works.
- Only WAR can cheese **Elemental Purge** while still having a low enough cooldown for the invuln to be back up during **Howling Eight**.
  - This forces WAR to invuln the 3rd tower during **Howling Eight** instead, so make absolutely sure that the intentions are communicated beforehand!
- There's 82 seconds between the first and the last tower in **Howling Eight**, which means your 90s second mitigations, if you have them, will not be up for the last tower if you used them in the first tower.
  - WAR/PLD can use their 90s very early instead if they want, since their shield lasts 30s.
