The Howling Fang will cast <strong>Terrestrial Rage</strong>, which is a barrage of smaller mechanics that are condensed into one. You will likely have seen the mechanics before in normal mode, but chances are, you will still be caught off guard due to the much faster pace of this fight. 

There will be another <Tankbuster>Great Divide</Tankbuster> at the end of this mechanic, so it is recommended that the ST provokes right now if the MT was the one who invulned the first <Tankbuster>Great Divide</Tankbuster>. You will be given plenty of opportunities to establish the highest aggro during this mechanic, but now is the earliest opportunity for you to do so.

## Terrestrial Rage

The Howling Fang will place four of his drones diagonally onto the arena, which will fire lasers in a straight line. These drones will not all fire their lasers at the same time, but instead, will fire their lasers based on the order they appear in. There are two drone groups and the pairs belonging in the same group are always spaced from each other, which may make it easier to identify the drone groupings when you are about to execute the dodge.

While you are trying to dodge the lasers, one random role group will have to deal with a spread AoE, while the other role group will have to deal with a stack. The spread AoEs are resolved on the cardinal waymarks using clockspot priority, while the stack is done in the middle. Which role group getting which is random, so try and preposition near your colorcoded cardinal waymark to be as close as possible to your two possible positions. Once you've identified whether you're AoE or stack/nothing, you can make the necessary adjustment without too much movement.

Remember that this mechanic is always true north no matter what!


## Shadowchase

You might notice the boss casting <strong>Shadowchase</strong> while you were trying to dodge the lasers. Just like in normal mode, <strong>Shadowchase</strong> basically creates 5 shadows and 5 wolf heads that will fire a line AoE through the middle of the arena, an attack which you can safely dodge by simply being behind those shadows. This mechanic isn't anything special by itself, but this is once again combined with the spread/stack mechanic, forcing everyone to split up to prevent the spread from clipping each other.

The roles are swapped here: whichever role group had stack during <strong>Terrestrial Rage</strong> will now have to resolve spread here, and vice versa. There are two <strong>Shadowchase</strong> patterns to deal with, but otherwise, this isn't a difficult mechanic.

## Eminent/Revolutionary Reign

**Eminent Reign** or <strong>Revolutionary Reign</strong> makes a return, but with a twist! The mechanic will go as normal, but at the very end, two wolf of stones will be at the background to snipe any unsuspecting party members with a line AoE. 

The two wolf heads are always spaced out from each other, so thats something you can use as reference when identifying where the possible safe spots are. Once again, <strong>Eminent Reign</strong> is easier because the wolf heads would be right in front of you, whereas <strong>Revolutionary Reign</strong> can catch you off guard due to it being so far away.

Whether Howling Blade's sneak attack worked or not, the boss will use <Tankbuster>Great Divide</Tankbuster> on the player with the highest enmity. If the aggro was managed properly, then it should be on the tank who can cheese this by using his/her invuln.
