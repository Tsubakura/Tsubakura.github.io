The general rule of this fight is that both tanks needs to have their stance on at all times. During phase 1, some of the attacks will fire tankbusters on two players with the highest enmity, while in phase 2, the tankbusters are now combined with auto attacks targeting two players. If you happen to be a tank, then make sure to establish aggro as soon as possible if you died anywhere during this fight.

Upon pulling the Howling Blade, he will do a few auto attacks before casting <Raidwide>Extraplanar Pursuit</Raidwide>, which is the generic raidwide of this fight. This raidwide is considered **physical**, so applying your feint is that much more important, especially when this raidwide hits quite hard.

If you happen to have 90s party mitigations, then you are recommended to use them early here so its usable again for a multi-hit stack marker later in this fight. Not the end of the world if you forget about it, but its definitely something your healers will appreciate.

## Windfang/Stonefang

After survival the initial raidwide, the boss will now randomly use either <strong>Windfang</strong> or <strong>Stonefang</strong>. <strong>Windfang</strong> is a two-man stack protean which is combined with a donut, while <strong>Stonefang</strong> is a chariot combined with a spread protean.

Regardless of whether the boss uses <strong>Windfang</strong> or <strong>Stonefang</strong>, this is also combined with the boss himself firing lasers in a 十 or X shape, which further limits the available space for your party to resolve the mechanic. The shape of the laser can be identified by the direction in which the orbiting sattelites around the boss are aimed at.

Overally, this is not a hard mechanic, but use this moment to train yourself on the recognition of the patterns in this mechanic. This mechanic will make a return in [Beckon Moonlight](/savage/m8s/beckon_moonlight), but with its cast speed cranked up to eleven, so you better be ready when that moment comes.
