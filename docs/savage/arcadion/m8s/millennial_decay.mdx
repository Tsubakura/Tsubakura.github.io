The general rule of this fight is that both tank needs to have their stance on at all times. During phase 1, some of the attacks will fire tankbusters on two players with the highest enmity, while in phase 2, the tankbusters are now combined with auto attacks targeting two players. If you happen to be a tank, then make sure to establish aggro as soon as possible if you died anywhere during this fight.

Upon pulling the Howling Blade, he will do a few auto attacks before casting <Raidwide>Extraplanar Pursuit</Raidwide>, which is the generic raidwide of this fight. This raidwide is considered **physical**, so applying your feint is that much more important, especially when this raidwide hits quite hard.

If you happen to have 90s party mitigations, then you are recommended to use them early here so its usable again for a multi-hit stack marker later in this fight. Not the end of the world if you forget about it, but its definitely something your healers will appreciate.

## Windfang/Stonefang

After survival the initial raidwide, the boss will now randomly use either <strong>Windfang</strong> or <strong>Stonefang</strong>. <strong>Windfang</strong> is a two-man stack protean which is combined with a donut, while <strong>Stonefang</strong> is a chariot combined with a spread protean.

Regardless of whether the boss uses <strong>Windfang</strong> or <strong>Stonefang</strong>, this is also combined with the boss himself firing lasers in a 十 or X shape, which further limits the available space for your party to resolve the mechanic. The shape of the laser can be identified by the direction in which the orbiting sattelites around the boss are aimed at.

Overally, this is not a hard mechanic, but use this moment to train yourself on the recognition of the patterns in this mechanic. This mechanic will make a return in [Beckon Moonlight](/savage/m8s/beckon_moonlight), but with its cast speed cranked up to eleven, so you better be ready when that moment comes.

## Eminent/Revolutionary Reign

The next recurring mechanic you will encounter is <strong>Eminent Reign</strong> or <strong>Revolutionary Reign</strong>, which is also random depending on the mood of the boss. The boss will create three shadows and randomly jump to one of the three spots. Upon landing, he will dash in a straight line to the other side of the map and then perform an attack. This attack will either be a wide cone if its <strong>Eminent Reign</strong> or a giant chariot if its <strong>Revolutionary Reign</strong>.

That's not all! Regardless of whether the boss uses <strong>Eminent Reign</strong> or <strong>Revolutionary Reign</strong>, the two highest enmity players will be tankbustered with a wide cone (<Tankbuster>Reign's End</Tankbuster>), while both healers will be targeted by a three-man stack protean (<strong>Sovereign Scar</strong>). If one of the tanks forgot to manage their aggro/stance before, then this is the place where you will likely wipe. 

### Eminent Reign

Of the two attacks, <strong>Eminent Reign</strong> is the easier one, because the whole area behind him is safe for your party to resolve the tankbusters and light party stacks. Chase him down once the Howling Blade does his line dash and get into position to resolve the tankbusters and stacks.

The stack protean is small, so the healers should plant at their spot as soon as they can to make it easier for their party members to stack with them. The tanks can use the rear/flank positionals as their guide for positioning themselves.

        <td><KittenAsset path='m8s/eminent_reign_example3.webm' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Revolutionary Reign

**Revolutionary Reign** is harder for two reasons: The first reason is that you're more likely to clip each other by accident, because being further away from the boss means the proteans are also larger. More often than not, you will get a situation where the tank accidentally kills their party members because of this. The second reason is that it is hard for tanks to accurately judge where they can stand without killing their party members or themselves.

The size of the chariot always takes up at least 90 degrees of both sides. If geometry happens to be your strong suit, then draw a 90 degrees angle from where the boss is dashing to and take on step backwards. Otherwise, use whichever method you personally find to be the most consistent in giving you the results you want.

**Revolutionary Reign** is a tank mechanic, so the party's responsibility is making sure that the maximum amount of error margin is given to the tanks, which minimizes the chance that they end up slaughtering the party instead. This is achieved by a very simple trick which the healers and DPS can do: Take a step into where the line AoE of the dash was to resolve your 3-man stack.

    </tr>

Regardless of whether you're dealing with <strong>Eminent Reign</strong> or <strong>Revolutionary Reign</strong>, the attacks aimed at the tanks are considered tankbusters. While not doing much damage, it is still high enough that it can oneshot a healthy tank if he/she doesn't bother pressing any mitigations at all.

All the attacks during <strong>Eminent Reign</strong> and <strong>Revolutionary Reign</strong> are considered physical. If possible, try to use reprisal or feint on the boss before he jumps away. This will help mitigate the attacks of this mechanic, but as a plus, it will also help mitigate the <Raidwide>Extraplanar Pursuit</Raidwide> that immediately comes after once you're done with this.
