The general rule of this fight is that both tank needs to have their stance on at all times. During phase 1, some of the attacks will fire tankbusters on two players with the highest enmity, while in phase 2, the tankbusters are now combined with auto attacks targeting two players. If you happen to be a tank, then make sure to establish aggro as soon as possible if you died anywhere during this fight.

Upon pulling the Howling Blade, he will do a few auto attacks before casting <Raidwide>Extraplanar Pursuit</Raidwide>, which is the generic raidwide of this fight. This raidwide is considered **physical**, so applying your feint is that much more important, especially when this raidwide hits quite hard.

If you happen to have 90s party mitigations, then you are recommended to use them early here so its usable again for a multi-hit stack marker later in this fight. Not the end of the world if you forget about it, but its definitely something your healers will appreciate.

## Windfang/Stonefang

After survival the initial raidwide, the boss will now randomly use either <strong>Windfang</strong> or <strong>Stonefang</strong>. <strong>Windfang</strong> is a two-man stack protean which is combined with a donut, while <strong>Stonefang</strong> is a chariot combined with a spread protean.

Regardless of whether the boss uses <strong>Windfang</strong> or <strong>Stonefang</strong>, this is also combined with the boss himself firing lasers in a 十 or X shape, which further limits the available space for your party to resolve the mechanic. The shape of the laser can be identified by the direction in which the orbiting sattelites around the boss are aimed at.

Overally, this is not a hard mechanic, but use this moment to train yourself on the recognition of the patterns in this mechanic. This mechanic will make a return in [Beckon Moonlight](/savage/m8s/beckon_moonlight), but with its cast speed cranked up to eleven, so you better be ready when that moment comes.

## Eminent/Revolutionary Reign

The next recurring mechanic you will encounter is <strong>Eminent Reign</strong> or <strong>Revolutionary Reign</strong>, which is also random depending on the mood of the boss. The boss will create three shadows and randomly jump to one of the three spots. Upon landing, he will dash in a straight line to the other side of the map and then perform an attack. This attack will either be a wide cone if its <strong>Eminent Reign</strong> or a giant chariot if its <strong>Revolutionary Reign</strong>.

That's not all! Regardless of whether the boss uses <strong>Eminent Reign</strong> or <strong>Revolutionary Reign</strong>, the two highest enmity players will be tankbustered with a wide cone (<Tankbuster>Reign's End</Tankbuster>), while both healers will be targeted by a three-man stack protean (<strong>Sovereign Scar</strong>). If one of the tanks forgot to manage their aggro/stance before, then this is the place where you will likely wipe. 

### Eminent Reign

Of the two attacks, <strong>Eminent Reign</strong> is the easier one, because the whole area behind him is safe for your party to resolve the tankbusters and light party stacks. Chase him down once the Howling Blade does his line dash and get into position to resolve the tankbusters and stacks.

<KittenAsset path='m8s/eminent_reign.png' wrapper='div' width='40%' />

The stack protean is small, so the healers should plant at their spot as soon as they can to make it easier for their party members to stack with them. The tanks can use the rear/flank positionals as their guide for positioning themselves.

    </tr>

### Revolutionary Reign

**Revolutionary Reign** is harder for two reasons: The first reason is that you're more likely to clip each other by accident, because being further away from the boss means the proteans are also larger. More often than not, you will get a situation where the tank accidentally kills their party members because of this. The second reason is that it is hard for tanks to accurately judge where they can stand without killing their party members or themselves.

The size of the chariot always takes up at least 90 degrees of both sides. If geometry happens to be your strong suit, then draw a 90 degrees angle from where the boss is dashing to and take one step backwards. Otherwise, use whichever method you personally find to be the most consistent in giving you the results you want.

**Revolutionary Reign** is a tank mechanic, so the party's responsibility is making sure that the maximum amount of error margin is given to the tanks, which minimizes the chance that they end up slaughtering the party instead. This is achieved by a very simple trick which the healers and DPS can do: Take a step into where the line AoE of the dash was to resolve your 3-man stack.

Regardless of whether you're dealing with <strong>Eminent Reign</strong> or <strong>Revolutionary Reign</strong>, the attacks aimed at the tanks are considered tankbusters. While weak compared to the other tankbusters, the damage is still high enough that it can oneshot a healthy tank if he/she doesn't bother pressing any mitigations at all.

All the attacks during <strong>Eminent Reign</strong> and <strong>Revolutionary Reign</strong> are considered physical. If possible, try to use reprisal or feint on the boss before he jumps away. This will help mitigate the attacks of this mechanic, but as a plus, it will also help mitigate the <Raidwide>Extraplanar Pursuit</Raidwide> that immediately comes after once you're done with this.

## Millennial Decay

With the tutorial out of the way, the Howling Blade jumps to the middle of the arena in order to prepare his first major mechanic, which is <Raidwide>Millennial Decay</Raidwide>. Mitigate this attack if you can, because this cast does considerable damage on its own. As MT, if you applied your reprisal after your first gcd in the opener, then it should be back up again here for this raidwide.

This mechanic is split into two parts: The first part has you dodging line AOEs from the green dragon heads, which forces you to rotate around the arena. The second part has you deal with four tethers and four towers that your party needs to resolve, which is then followed by a multi-hit stack marker and a raidwide.

### Millennial Decay Part 1

At the start, one green wolf head will randomly spawn either north or south of the arena. Once the first one has spawned, more heads will spawn sequentially next to the first head, up to 5 dragon heads in total, which will fire a line AoE in the order they spawn in. Getting hit is obviously a bad idea, so to avoid those attacks, you will have to either spin clockwise or counterclockwise with your party. In order to figure out which way you have to spin, you will have to look at where the 2nd head has spawned.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th colspan='2'>Clockwise</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m8s/millennial_decay_clockwise_north_heads.png' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m8s/millennial_decay_clockwise_south_heads.png' /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th colspan='2'>Counterclockwise</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m8s/millennial_decay_counterclockwise_north_heads.png' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m8s/millennial_decay_counterclockwise_south_heads.png' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

This mechanic would be really easy if all you had to do was spin around, so to spice things up, the Howling Blade will cast two sets of AoEs and a knockback to attack your party with. Each AoE set will target a role group and your goal as a party is to let the AoE resolve without accidentally clipping anyone or getting hit by the line AoE shot from the wolf heads.

### IQ6000 strategy

Dubbed the IQ6000 strategy, the JP came up with a strategy that fixes the spots which the players can use to resolve their AoEs. Although designed with the intention to be more friendly towards casters, this strategy also creates structure in how the players can resolve this mechanic.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan='2'>1.</td>
        <td colspan='4' rowspan='2' width='40%'>Preposition near your own quadrant and determine first whether you have the AoE or not. If you do, then preposition yourself in a way that allows you to resolve the AoE near the intercardinal walls. If you're not, then go to west/east of the boss, safely away from the players who has an AoE.<br /><br />The first AoE will resolve immediately after the boss knocks you back, so using anti-knockback like Arm's Length and Surecast is recommended. For reference, you can use your anti-knockback as early as when the first head has appeared!<br /><br />Keep in mind that the positions are <strong>true north</strong>, regardless of whether the first wolf head spawns north or south.</td>

There is a body check in the next part, so try not to die here. Below are some examples you can use for reference to survive this merry go round.

### Millennial Decay Part 2

Now here's the easier part of Millennial Decay: Four wolf heads will spawn on either cardinals or intercardinals, and tether to a role group. The wolf head will then fire a cone AoE at the tethered player, killing the player if the tether was not stretched. In order to make the attack non-fatal, you will have to stretch the tether by going to the opposite side of where the head. You will know its properly stretched when the tether turns purple.

At the same time, four towers will spawn cardinally or intercardinally, depending on which spot the wolf heads hasn't claimed. The tethered players are busy dealing with the wolf heads, so the other role group has the task to soak those towers in order to prevent them from exploding. The towers are color coded, so finding your tower should be easy by checking your two waymark colors. Be careful though if you're either ST or D2, because your C waymark is missing.

The boss will use another knockback here, so if you haven't used your anti-knockback yet, then here's another opportunity for you to use it if you wish. Otherwise, this mechanic isn't hard as long as you do due diligence in identifying whether you have a tether or not. Visibility can be poor, so try to wiggle around if you're unsure whether you have the tether or not.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Example 1<br />Tower<br /><Role role='MT' /></th>
        <th>Example 2<br />Tether<br /><Role role='D1' /></th>
        <th>Example 3<br />Tower<br /><Role role='MT' /></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m8s/millennial_decay_part2_example1.webm' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m8s/millennial_decay_part2_example2.webm' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m8s/millennial_decay_part2_example3.webm' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

Now, chances are, there will be deaths during part 1, which would mean that towers will explode. Each tower missing will deal massive damage by itself, but will also inflict a strong bleed that will kill your party unless your healers are quick to react. You can salvage the situation with bruteforce healing if there's only 1 tower exploding, but 2 or 3 and you will have to resort to using tank LB just to not die instantly.

After having dealt with the wolf heads and towers, get to the center quickly as the boss will use <strong>Tracking Tremors</strong>, which is a multi-hit stack marker that your party needs to soak together. If you have used your 90s mitigation early at the opener, then it should be back up for this mechanic. Try to time your 15s mitigations to the last second, because after the stack marker, the boss will use <Raidwide>Extraplanar Pursuit</Raidwide> as a finishing touch. If your mitigations are timed well, then your 15s will cover all the stack hits and the raidwide after.

<KittenAsset path='m8s/great_divide1.webm' wrapper='div' />

After a brief pause, the Howling Blade will cast <Tankbuster>Great Divide</Tankbuster>, which is a line tankbuster that is meant to be soaked by two tanks, on the player with the highest aggro. Although you can do this the intentional way, the most popular method by far is to just cheese it with an invuln, so have your MT do right that.
