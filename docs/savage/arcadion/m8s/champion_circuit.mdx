The south island will be restored upon resolving <strong>Twofold Tempest</strong>. While it doesn't matter which island you go to for the next mechanic, you are recommended to be somewhere close that allows you to quickly teleport to your quake island. 

## Champion's Circuit

As the Howling Blade charges up <strong>Champion's Circuit</strong>, he will show five different attack patterns that he will use to attack your platform with. The attack patterns are cycled either clockwise or counterclockwise, and your goal in this mechanic is to dodge all the attacks from the boss while also dodging the drone lasers that are sneakily trying to snipe you from behind.

The good news is that the attack pattern from the boss is completely fixed. There is randomness involved, like which island the boss is facing first and which direction he is spinning, but knowing that the attack patterns are fixed means that you can just memorize the whole pattern to trivialize this mechanic.

Upon memorizing the pattern, you should be able to deduce the whole sequence by just looking at the first two patterns of the incoming attack. If you need more references, then keep in mind that the middle cleave is always the front of the boss, while the donut originates from the white wolf on his left hand. The remaining three pattern is a fixed in > out > in pattern, so in doubt, just go in first and you should be fine.

There's no tricks here, but simple pattern recognition and the execution of the dodges. Just keep in mind that while you're dodging the attacks, the drones will cleave one half of your island, similar to what you've seen before in <strong>Ultraviolent Ray</strong>, but otherwise, this mechanic shouldn't be difficult.

Once the boss is done spinning around, your party will have to deal with <strong>Quake III</strong>, <strong>Ultraviolent Ray</strong> and a <Tankbuster>Twinbite</Tankbuster>, in that order. You've seen those mechanics before, so deal with them accordingly.

Remember to help your tanks with the mitigations, especially if you have a WAR in your party. The tanks cannot use their invulnerability here, as it will not be up for the final mechanic otherwise, but feel free to kitchen sink all their mitigations here instead. All your mitigations will be back up by the time you reach the final mechanic.
