This next mechanic is a breeze, compared to the onslaught of mechanics you've faced so far. Howling Fang will summon two stone structures with <strong>Terrestrial Titans</strong>, which will rise up from the ground and inflict an embarrassing damage down if you were standing on the area where the stone was rising. The boss will then proceed to cleave the two structures in half with <Raidwide>Titanic Pursuit</Raidwide>, which will cause the structures to collapse onto the arena.

## Terrestrial Titans

The stone structures can spawn either west/east or north/south, but that is completely irrelevant aside from not getting hit by it while it is erupting from the ground. What you do have to remember though, is that the safe spots are always two of the intercardinal waymarks that are opposite of each other.

To easily identify those two potential safe spots, you basically look at how the structures are being cut. The cuts are always diagonal and in the same direction for both structures, which also happens to align with the two potential safespots!

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m8s/terrestrial_titan_pattern1.png' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m8s/terrestrial_titan_pattern2.png' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m8s/terrestrial_titan_pattern3.png' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m8s/terrestrial_titan_pattern4.png' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

Upon identifying the cut, you should be able to spot both safespots for this gold saucer mechanic. Unfortunately, you can't use both safespots as the boss will now place an X-shaped drone and a 十 shaped drone in the arena to blast you with, which will also make one of the potential safespots unsafe.

        <td><KittenAsset path='m8s/terrestrial_titan_pattern2.png' /></td>
        <td>&gt;</td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m8s/terrestrial_titan_pattern2a.png' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

You want to be looking for the X-shaped drone, which is the safe drone that allows you to stay near the safespot. Or alternatively, use process of elimination and go to the other side once you've identified that your side has a 十 shaped drone. Theres always only one X-shaped drone and one 十 shaped drone that are opposite of each other, so keep that in mind while solving this mechanic.

If you're having difficulty reaching your safespot on time, then you can opt for using your sprint here. Overally, this isn't a hard mechanic and you're more likely to die if you were trying to greed. With the stone structures cleared, the boss will use either <strong>Eminent Reign</strong> or <strong>Revolutionary Reign</strong>, which is something you've seen before. Time to move on to the next mechanic.
