Deep Blue has enough of the charade and calls Red Hot to join the fight, which makes this a double boss fight from hereon. Good, this means you can end this fight faster by fighting them both at once, instead of having to defeat them one by one.

Have the ST provoke Red Hot immediately, so to prevent both bosses from ganging up on the MT.

## Xtreme Spectacular

Once both bosses appear together, your caster now has the opportunity to use their LB to hit them both. Unless you are in a parse party, you are expected as a caster to be LBing here if you're playing in PF. Be quick though if you intend to LB, as the boss will become untargetable as soon as they finish casting <Raidwide>Xtreme Spectacular</Raidwide>.

The raidwide does not hit hard at all, luckily, but are you still required to move north or south due to the proximity attack. While the direction you go to is inconsequential as long as you are properly mitigated, the JP PFs have a preference of going south so that everyone is stacked together.

Seeing as there's two targets, you want to switch to your AoE attacks if they are a gain on two. Throughout this fight, the tanks should work together in bringing the boss together as often as possible, as that allows players to cleave them both. This is especially strong if their attacks are multi-target to begin with, like that of the VPR or DNC.

Do not worry about balancing the HP, because even though both bosses have a separate health bar, the total HP of the bosses are shared and thus it does not matter which one you attack.

## Insane Air

Cleave as much as you can while they are still together, because the bosses will soon split up. Your party should do the same, by having the MT group go after Deep Blue in the northwest corner, while the ST group takes care of Red Hot in the southeast corner.

During this phase, the bosses will be riding on their surfboard and cast <strong>Insane Air</strong> to surf to their next destination, which is telegraphed by a watery/fiery line that leads to a surfboard icon. This surfboard icon telegraphes what kind of attack the boss will be doing once they arrive at their destination, which range from a tankbuster, a 4-man protean spread or a 4-man stack.

For this mechanic, both Deep Blue and Red Hot will use <strong>Insane Air</strong> up to four times in a row. As a party, you will have to correctly identify the attack in order to preposition accordingly.

As you might have noticed from the examples, the ST group who is responsible for Red Hot has it more difficult, mainly because the attacks from him will also leave behind an area of denial effect on the floor. As a general rule, all attacks should be baited towards the wall as much as possible in order to not accidentally snipe the other party and also to minimize the problems caused by the fire puddles.

Once you're done with the mechanic, have the tanks clump up the bosses together. This will allow your party to maximize cleave damage while also making it convenient for the tanks to use reprisal on them. The reprisal will be needed here, because they will wrap this phase up with a <Raidwide>Divers' Dare</Raidwide>, which you will notice that it hits a lot more harder than before since both bosses are now using them at the same time.

## Cursed pattern

The mechanic is rather straightforward, but there is one peculiar pattern that has caused wipes in PF, which is when Red Hot's first <strong>Insane Air</strong> is a <strong>Plunging Snap</strong>.

The problem here is that the ST group usually spreads out too far apart, the ST and D2 especially, which causes the southeast corner to be covered in fire. This is a problem because one of the possible patterns for Deep Blue is that he goes to the southeast corner for his final <strong>Insane Air</strong>, which is now covered in fire because of the ST group. This is effectively a wipe if Deep Blue also uses a <strong>Plunging Snap</strong> for the final attack, because there is effectively no space left to spread out.

The solution is simple, don't cover the southeast corner in fire and you will not cause a wipe.
