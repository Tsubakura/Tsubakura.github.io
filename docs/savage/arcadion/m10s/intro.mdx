Game8 follows [Inumaru](https://youtu.be/B0cH0HmcPk4?si=Legyc1lRl9jegL6N) as base, with further modifications done by [IENASHI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvWR-ARutLU) to form the game8 strategy that is used now in PF.
- Once both bosses appear together, the MT maintains aggro on Deep Blue, while the ST maintains aggro on Red Hot.
- The healers are sent into the [Watery Grave](/savage/m10s/watery_grave), instead of the tanks, which was the early strategy in week 1.
  - You can discuss this with the party if you as a non-healer wants to be sent into the bubble instead, but make sure that the healer agrees with your swap.
- The final <Tankbuster>Deep Impact</Tankbuster> tankbuster from Deep Blue is baited by the tank that has aggro on him at that moment.
  - This can be discussed with your cotank, but with no prior communications, you can assume that you will be the one baiting the tankbuster if you have the aggro.
