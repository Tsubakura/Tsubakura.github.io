After getting through the <strong>Insane Air</strong>, the two bosses will return to the middle and prepare <Raidwide>Firesnaking</Raidwide>/<Raidwide>Watersnaking</Raidwide>. 

<KittenAsset path='m10s/snaking_intro.webm' wrapper='div' />

Immediately put the MT group under Deep Blue and the ST group under Red Hot, because the bosses are about to apply debuffs based on proximity.

<table width='100%'>
    <tr>
        <th>Debuff</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th width='20%'>Additional note</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src={watersnaking_icon_hr} /><img src={firesnaking_icon_hr} /></td>
        <td><center><strong>Watersnaking & Firesnaking</strong></center><br />The snaking debuffs will determine whether you will be attacked by the Deep Blue or Red Hot for the upcoming mechanics. The bosses will apply this debuff on either the four closest players or the four furthest players away from them, which means that all members of a light party will always get the same debuffs as long as they are prepositioned correctly.<br /><br />If you get the opposite debuff, e.g. getting fire debuff as MT, then the tanks need to swap bosses by provoking the boss that aligns with their debuff.</td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m10s/snaking_debuff.png' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

You want all four of same debuffs to be applied on all the members of a light party each. Failure to do so will very likely cause a wipe, so make sure to preposition properly before the cast finishes!

## Snaking

Your role in this mechanic is dependent on which debuff you have, which will be further elaborated here below.
