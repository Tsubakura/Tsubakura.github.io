Deep Blue will cast <strong>Deep Aerial</strong>, which will create a two-man tower in the middle. The two players who soak the tower will now get trapped in a bubble called the Watery Grave and the party has 1 minute to destroy this bubble before it kills the people inside, wiping the party.

Send the two healer inside and get ready for the incoming attacks.

## Watery Grave

Deep Blue and Red Hot will both jump either to north or south, and tether two random players for their <strong>Xtreme Wave</strong>. This tether must be stretched in order for the hit to not be lethal, but there's also another property regarding these attacks.

Whenever Deep Blue's <strong>Xtreme Wave</strong> hits the bubble, the bubble will get a temporary defense buff which will make it harder for your party to DPS it down. On the other hand, if Red Hot's <strong>Xtreme Wave</strong> crashes through the bubble, then it will shave off 15% of its HP while also generating a small raidwide explosion. You are not going to destroy the Watery Grave with raw DPS alone, so you must make use of Red Hot's attacks to destroy the bubble.

The players who did not get the tethers should move towards the side where the boss is to avoid getting clipped by the dashes.<br /><br /><KittenAsset path='m10s/watery_grave_1.webm' /></td>

        <td>The braindead setup has been created. The dashes can now be resolved by simply making both bosses dashing back and forth, up to 6 times in total, until the bubble is destroyed. The non-tether players should stay on the side far away from Deep Blue, at max melee range, and attack the bubble. Be careful not to hit the bubble with the Deep Blue dash and you should be able to pass this mechanic very easily.<br /><br /><KittenAsset path='m10s/watery_grave_2.webm' /></td>

Once the bubble has been destroyed, the bosses will end this phase with a <Raidwide>Divers' Dare</Raidwide>.

## Should I use my burst during the Watery Grave?

The general consensus in PF is to hold your burst, because you will get an opportunity to cleave both bosses once the bubble is destroyed. Destroying the bubble does not require any burst, but your party can consider bursting early if:
1. There has been a death or someone accidentally cleaved the bubble with Deep Blue's wave, which will impact the DPS check.
2. You are progging, not (re)clearing.

Keep in mind that clearing the fight is possible no matter what as the DPS check is not that tight, so its not the end of the world if you do burst early in this mechanic.
