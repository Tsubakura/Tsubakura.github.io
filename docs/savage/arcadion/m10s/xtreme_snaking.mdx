Inflict as much cleave damage as possible, until the bosses jumps back to the middle and starts their casts, which is <Raidwide>Xtreme Watersnaking</Raidwide>/<Raidwide>Xtreme Firesnaking</Raidwide>. The cast itself is a strong raidwide, so don't forget to mitigate this!

<KittenAsset path='m10s/xtreme_snaking_intro.webm' wrapper='div' />

Immediately preposition yourself the same way as you did in [snaking](/savage/m10s/snaking), because the bosses will inflict debuffs again on the four closest or the four furthest players from them. As a reminder, MT group is with Deep Blue while ST group is with Red Hot, no matter what the current aggro is.

Thus, you cannot cleanse multiple people in the same light party at once.<br /><br /> The bosses will apply this debuff on either the four closest players or the four furthest players away from them, which means that all members of a light party will always get the same debuffs as long as they are prepositioned correctly.<br /><br />Tank swapping here is optional. If one of the tanks does decide to provoke, then the other tank must provoke the other boss in order to prevent both bosses from attacking the same tank. Keep your eyes on the enmity meter.</td>

## Insane Air

This mechanic plays out exactly the same way as [Insane Air](/savage/m10s/insane_air), but the twist here is that you now have to deal with the debuff. Cleansing them all at once at the same time is suicide, so you need some rules to decide who is going to swap around in order to cleanse the debuffs one by one. For now, check your debuff and go to the boss that matches your element. If you have fire, you go to Red Hot and if you have water, you go to Deep Blue. 

The bosses will do four <strong>Insane Air</strong> each, but the patterns this time is more fixed as you will always see 1 stack, 1 tankbuster and 2 spreads in a random order. The attacks are also mirrorred, which means that if one bosses does a spread, you can assume that the other boss will also be a spread. With this information, you can decide on a priority system based on the type of attacks the bosses are doing.

        <td><center><Role role='H1' /><Role role='H2' /></center></td>
        <td><center><Role role='MT' /><Role role='ST' /></center></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td colspan='2'>There exists PFs that prefers to simplify it by combining spread and stack together. In this case, the prio system will be as follows:<br /><Role role='H1' /><Role role='H2' /><LargeText>&gt;</LargeText><Role role='D1' /><Role role='D2' /><LargeText>&gt;</LargeText><Role role='D3' /><Role role='D4' /><br />If its not specified in the PF description, then you can safely assume that the party is not using this simplified priority system.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

With the priority system in place, you can now start resolving the mechanics the same as you did in [Insane Air](/savage/m10s/insane_air), swapping whenever its your turn to swap. The swap is a **permaswap**, so theres no need for you to return back to your original light party.

If the two light parties are too close to each other, which can happen on the last <strong>Insane Air</strong>, then make sure to create some distance while cleansing in order to prevent the explosions from overlapping both parties.

        <th>Example 1<br /><Role role='ST' /></th>
        <th>Example 2<br /><Role role='D2' /></th>

After the 4th <strong>Insane Air</strong>, the bosses will wrap this phase up with a <Raidwide>Divers' Dare</Raidwide>. You should know the drill by now, clump them up together for maximum cleave damage and mitigate the raidwide.

## Final mechanic into the enrage sequence

Chances are, the bosses will be defeated here, but if the DPS is lacking, then read on as the boss has one more mechanic up his sleeve.

Deep Blue will jump to the middle of the arena and spray the party with either <strong>Alley-oop Double-dip</strong> or <strong>Reverse Alley-oop</strong>. Now, this wouldnt be much of a challenge normally, but Red Hot will at the same time also chuck fireballs at all the players with <strong>Alley-oop Inferno</strong>, which forces all players to spread out to their walls.

The fireballs will hit during the second set of proteans, so you need to coordinate the movements if Deep Blue is using a double here. In PF, the agreed movement is to spread out to your own true north clockspots and to rotate clockwise if its a double in order to not overlap the fireballs.

<KittenAsset path='m10s/final_alley-oop_reverse.webm' wrapper='div' />

Now, two things will happen in sequence: Red Hot will cast <strong>Pyrotation</strong>, which is the triple stack attack that you've seen at the start of this fight. While that is happening, Deep Blue will also use <Tankbuster>Deep Impact</Tankbuster> to strike the furthest target from him. 

Start the stack under Deep Blue, who could either be north or south, depending on which tank has the aggro on him. Once the stack hits, have the party draw a line towards north or south, depending on which side you started. The tank who is responsible for taking the tankbuster should immediately run off, popping Arm's Length and whatever mitigations he/she has left.

If there was no prior communications in the PF, then whoever currently has the aggro on Deep Blue is responsible for taking the tankbuster. Make absolutely sure that the tankbuster does not strike the party.

    <tr>
        <th>Pyrotation group</th>
        <th>Deep Impact</th>
    </tr>

        <td><KittenAsset path='m10s/final_pyrotation.webm' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m10s/final_deep_impact.webm' /></td>
    </tr>

If you still have a caster LB3, then now is the perfect time to use it as there are no more mechanics after this. If the bosses are not defeated yet at this point, then they will first fire off a <Raidwide>Divers' Dare</Raidwide> to clean up all the fire around them. This is then followed up by another <Raidwide>Divers' Dare</Raidwide> which you have to mitigate.

If the bosses are still not defeated yet at this point, then this is when they will cast <Enrage>Over the Falls</Enrage>, which will wipe the party when successfully cast.
