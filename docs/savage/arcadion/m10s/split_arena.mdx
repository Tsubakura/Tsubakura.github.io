Upon escaping the water prison, your party has a short moment to cleave the two bosses as much as you can before they split up. Red Hot will use <strong>Flame Floater</strong> to dive down the middle, dividing the arena into a west and east half, while Deep Blue will use <strong>Sick Swell</strong> to create a tsunami, which you can ignore.

Split up your party by having the MT group go west, while the ST group go east. You will face another series of attacks, most of which are repeat mechanics but used in a different environment.

## Alley-oop Inferno

The first attack is the <strong>Alley-oop Inferno</strong>, in which Red Hot chucks fireballs at all players. As usual when it comes to Red Hot's attacks, place the fire puddles as close to the wall as possible to prevent the denial of area effect from hindering your party's movement.

## Alley-oop Double-dip or Reverse Alley-oop

Now here comes arguably the hardest part of this mechanic. Deep Blue will now randomly jump to either west or east, on top of that side's respective waymark, and cast either <strong>Alley-oop Double Dip</strong> or <strong>Reverse Alley-oop</strong>. The challenge of this mechanic stems from that the four other players are at the other side of the arena, which means they have to resolve the proteans while being far away from the boss.

Identify first whether Deep Blue is on your side or not, because this will determine how you will be baiting the proteans. Next, identify whether Deep Blue is using <strong>Alley-oop Double Dip</strong> or <strong>Reverse Alley-oop</strong>, because this will change how the party will dodge the secondary proteans.

### The far side

As mentioned earlier, the difficulty of this mechanic stems from the fact that the four players on the other side of the arena must resolve the protean successfully while being far away from the boss. Double dip will force the people to travel the extra mile in order to dodge the attack, while reverse requires the melee players to dodge in an unique way.

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th colspan='3'>Reverse Alley-oop</th>
    </tr>

        <td>&gt;</td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m10s/split_arena_reverse_2.png' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

Remember that Deep Blue can appear on either D or B waymarks, so keep your eyes peeled and adjust when necessary.

## Freaky Pyrotation

After dealing with the proteans, Red Hot will cast <strong>Freaky Pyrotation</strong> which will create a 2-man stack AoEs on either all supports or all DPSes. This mechanic is straightforward, simply go to your respective corner with your partner to resolve this mechanic.

## Sickest Take-off

While you were distracted by Red Hot's fireballs, Deep Blue has already taken off using his <strong>Sickest Take-off</strong> to surf down the tsunami. Unlike all his other takeoffs, this specific attack is always stack no matter what. As usual though, avoid being in the same lane as Deep Blue, don't get knocked into the fire or the wall, and stack together in order to resolve the stack balls.

Once that is resolved, the bosses will both use <Raidwide>Divers' Dare</Raidwide> to signal that this phase is over.

## Examples

The main challenge is having to deal with Deep Blue's alley-oop, but if your party is consistent with this mechanic, then all the other mechanics are likely not pose you any problems whatsoever. Below are some examples as references in order to see how the whole mechanic plays out.
