Game8 follows [Ponikone's strat](https://jp.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/13307902/blog/5542016/):

- Ponikone's strat is built up using [OneAce](https://raidplan.io/plan/XRJkJmu26ZeIB8GR) for P1, ishia/sari for P2 and [Lucrezia](https://youtu.be/iXHokr1t1wM?si=AbA3H_v7sgfR60wx&t=366) for P3.
  - [Ishia's P2 strategy](https://raidplan.io/plan/xE-q2Xqib9AGETwp) has largely faded out, with people being more in favor of [sari's strategy](https://x.com/sf_snff/status/1911437620619411542).
- All <strong>Pulp Smash</strong> spreads are boss relative.
- The adds in P1 are all pulled either northwest or west, depending on where it is safe.
  - game8 will tell you to always pull west, which isn't always followed in PF for a good reason.
- [Stoneringers 2](/savage/m7s/stoneringers_2) is done boss relative, based on the boss position after the lariat charge.


Other things to keep in mind:

- This fight has three phases, but there are no checkpoints in between.
- The burst window during P3 [Debris Deathmatch](/savage/m7s/debris_deathmatch) is commonly delayed until the adds are petrified.
  - Of course, you can always coordinate this with your party if you desire a different burst window alignment.
  - If you are playing D4 RDM, then consider bursting early outside of raidbuffs before [Debris Deathmatch](/savage/m7s/debris_deathmatch). You will get no opportunity to burst once you're stuck with the tether.
- Players commonly pot upon entering P3, before the boss is even targetable, with the goal of aligning the last pot window with the last 2 minute burst.
- There are two <strong>Slaminator</strong> in P3 that are commonly invulned instead of soaking it as a party:
  - PLD's Hallowed Ground will not be back up for the first <strong>Slaminator</strong> if he/she uses it for the first tankbuster in P1.
  - The second <strong>Slaminator</strong> can always be invulned, regardless of the tank, if they choose to use their invuln in P1.
