Game8 follows [Ponikone's strat](https://jp.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/13307902/blog/5542016/), which also went through a few changes as the JP playerbase back then were still debating about true north vs boss relative spread and the use of a strategy that allows more uptime vs ishia's P2 strategy.

- All <strong>Pulp Smash</strong> spreads are now boss relative.
- The adds in P1 are all pulled either northwest or west, depending on where it is safe.
- [Stoneringers 2](/savage/m7s/stoneringers_2) is done boss relative, based on the boss position after the lariat charge.
- [Ishia's P2 strategy](https://raidplan.io/plan/xE-q2Xqib9AGETwp) has largely faded out, with people being more in favor of [sari's strategy](https://x.com/sf_snff/status/1911437620619411542).

Other things to keep in mind:

- This fight has three phases, but there are no checkpoints in between.
- The burst window during P3 [Debris Deathmatch](/savage/m7s/debris_deathmatch) is commonly delayed until the adds are petrified.
  - Of course, you can always coordinate this with your party if you desire a different burst window alignment.
- Players commonly pot upon entering P3, before the boss is even targetable, with the goal of aligning the last pot window with the last 2 minute burst.
- There are two <strong>Slaminator</strong> in P3 that are commonly invulned instead of soaking it as a party:
  - PLD's Hallowed Ground will not be back up for the first <strong>Slaminator</strong> if he/she uses it for the first tankbuster.
  - The second <strong>Slaminator</strong> can always be invulned, regardless of the tank, if they choose to use their invuln in P1.
