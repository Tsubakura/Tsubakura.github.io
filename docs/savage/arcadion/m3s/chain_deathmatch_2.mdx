After the Brute Bomber is done showing off his flashy moves, he will cast his next combination of mechanics starting with <strong>Fuses of Fury</strong>, followed by <strong>Tag Team</strong> and finally, <strong>Chain Deathmatch</strong>.

## Chain Deathmatch

Fuses of Fury creates the same bomb field you have seen in [Final Fusedown](/savage/m3s/final_fusedown), but the difference is that the players themselves don't become a bomb. The bombs only serves as a distraction to what is happening, because the bombs will explode before the clones starts charging. 

Chain Deathmatch however, behaves a bit different this time. Similarly to [Chain Deathmatch 1](/savage/m3s/chain_deathmatch_1), the player needs to intentionally take a direct hit from the clone that the player is chained to. The difference this time however, is that everyone will also be chained towards the boss himself, who himself will use <strong>Murderous Mist</strong> in a random direction.

The same rules of [Chain Deathmatch 1](/savage/m3s/chain_deathmatch_1) applies however, so once you've dodged the bombs, you can position yourself to make sure that you get hit by both the clone that you're tethered to and the <strong>Murderous Mist</strong> that comes from the boss. The poison gas is spread in a 270 degrees angle in front of the boss, so in most cases, it is actually hard to not get hit by this attack.

After resolving the 2nd Tag Team, the boss will cast either <strong>Octoboom Dive</strong> or <strong>Quadroom Dive</strong>, followed by a <Raidwide>Brutal Impact</Raidwide> and a <Tankbuster>Knuckle Sandwich</Tankbuster>.
