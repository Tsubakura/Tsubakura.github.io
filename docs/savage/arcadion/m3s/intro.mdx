Game8 follows [Nukemaru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDu5NY7DIo):
- Nukemaru no longer uses clockspot for [Fusefield](/savage/m3s/fusefield) and has updated his video accordingly to use north CW priority.
- The <Tankbuster>Knuckle Sandwich</Tankbuster> can be invulned, which is recommended for the last two as the amount of hits increases as the fight drags on.
  - MT commonly invulns the one right after [Chain Deathmatch 2](/savage/m3s/chain_deathmatch_2).
  - ST commonly invulns the last tankbuster which occurs after the 2nd Barbarous Barrage mechanic, which happens after [Fuse or Foe](/savage/m3s/fuse_or_foe).


## Major Mechanics
- [Doping Draught 1](/savage/m3s/doping_1)
