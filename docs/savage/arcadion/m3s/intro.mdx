Game8 follows [Nukemaru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZDu5NY7DIo):
- Nukemaru no longer uses clockspot for [Fusefield](/savage/m3s/fusefield) and has updated his video accordingly to use north CW priority.
- The <Tankbuster>Knuckle Sandwich</Tankbuster> can be invulned, which is recommended for the last two as the amount of hits and damage increases as the fight drags on.
  - Communicate with your cotank as to which ones you intend to invuln.
  - A WAR can invuln the 1st, 3rd and 5th <Tankbuster>Knuckle Sandwich</Tankbuster>.
- With sufficient gear, it is possible to simply kitchen sink <Tankbuster>Knuckle Sandwich</Tankbuster> alone without the use of an invuln.
  - This should not be attempted after the boss uses his first doping draught without the proper gear.
  - This should absolutely not be attempted at all once the boss has used his 2nd doping draught.
- The <Tankbuster>Knuckle Sandwich</Tankbuster> happens five times throughout the fight:
  1. Immediately at the start right after <Raidwide>Brutal Impact</Raidwide>, at 0:16.
  2. After <Raidwide>Brutal Impact</Raidwide>, right after the boss popped his first [Doping Draught](/savage/m3s/doping_1), at 2:52.
  3. Immediately after resolving [Fusefield](/savage/m3s/fusefield), at 5:50.
  4. After <Raidwide>Brutal Impact</Raidwide> once you've resolved [Chain Deathmatch 2](/savage/m3s/chain_deathmatch_2), at 8:13.
  5. Immediately after the 2nd Barbarous Barrage mechanic, which happens after [Fuse or Foe](/savage/m3s/fuse_or_foe), at 10:10.
