Brute Bomber will start the fight with <Raidwide>Brutal Impact</Raidwide>, which is a multi-hit raidwide attack. This is followed up by a <Tankbuster>Knuckle Sandwich</Tankbuster>, which is a two-man tankbuster that also hits you multiple times. Keep in mind that shields are less effective when the attacks hits you multiple times, but otherwise, mitigate as necessary and you should be fine.

## Lariat

The first recurring mechanic of this fight is the lariat. The boss will either use <strong>Octuple Lariat</strong> or <strong>Quadruple Lariat</strong>, which is a chariot combined with a spread or two-man stack, depending on which one the boss uses. In case of a two-man stack, the supports are expected to move intercardinal towards their DPS partner.
