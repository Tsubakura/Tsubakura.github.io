Brute Bomber will start the fight with <Raidwide>Brutal Impact</Raidwide>, which is a multi-hit raidwide attack. This is followed up by a <Tankbuster>Knuckle Sandwich</Tankbuster>, which is a two-man tankbuster that targets the player with the highest enmity and happens to be also an attack that hits multiple times. Keep in mind that shields are less effective when the attacks hits you multiple times, but otherwise, mitigate as necessary and you should be fine.

## Octuple Lariat and Quadruple Lariat

The first recurring mechanic of this fight is the lariat. The boss will either use <strong>Octuple Lariat</strong> or <strong>Quadruple Lariat</strong>, which is a chariot combined with a spread or two-man stack, depending on which one the boss uses. In case of a two-man stack, the supports are expected to move intercardinal towards their DPS partner.

    </tr>
</table>


## Octoboom Dive and Quadroboom Dive

The second recurring mechanic of this fight are the dives. The boss will turn towards a random cardinal direction and use either <strong>Octoboom Dive</strong> or <strong>Quadroom Dive</strong>. The boss will dive to the end of the arena, inflicting a proximity based attack, and a spread or a two man-stack attack depending on which one is cast. Identify immediately which way the boss is jumping and stay away from there, as you take more damage the closer you are to the impact point. Once the boss has jumped, you can go to your positions to resolve the spread or stack. Use gapclosers if you have to. 

Keep in mind that the dives are always resolved boss-relative.

Once you've resolved the tutorial mechanics of this fight, the boss will use <Raidwide>Brutal Impact</Raidwide> and slam the ground a few times again. 


## Barbarous Barrage

Brute Bomber will now summon seven knockback towers that the party needs to soak in a fixed order with the correct amount of people. The order that the towers needs to be soaked in is always cardinal > intercardinal > center. The towers can spawn in two possible setups, either north/south start or west/east start. Split the light parties up with melees going North/West and the ranged going South/East. Facing the center, the light party 1 will knockback left while light party 2 will knockback to the right.

<table width='70%'>
    <tr>
        <th>North/South</th>
        <th>West/East</th>
    </tr>

        <td><KittenAsset path='m3s/barbarous_barrage_westeast.png' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

While trying to resolve the towers, the boss will jump to a random corner and spray <strong>Murderous Mist</strong> all over the arena. This attack covers a 270 degrees in front of the boss, so use the last tower in the middle to knockback yourself behind the boss in order to avoid being gassed. Here are some MT PoVs to see how the mechanic is resolved properly.

## Doping Draught

After you have survived the onslaught of bombs, the boss will teleport to the middle and use <strong>Doping Draught</strong> to have a sip of his drink. The boss will not attack during this part until he punches the referee away, so use this moment to recover if you have suffered casualties during the previous mechanic.

The doping does the following:
- All attacks now deal more damage, meaning that some of the attacks like lariat/dive now might require mitigation to survive.
- The boss can now change the properties of the lariat/dive attacks, which is signaled by the arms that are on fire when he is using those attacks.
  - Lariat attacks becomes donuts instead, you now have to get close to the boss instead.
  - Dive attacks becomes a knockback instead, meaning it is dangerous now to be far away from the impact point without an anti-knockback.

        <th>Dive (No fire)</th>

Once the boss has assaulted the referee, the boss will demonstrate his new moves by casting <strong>Octuple Lariat</strong> or <strong>Quadruple Lariat</strong>, followed by either <strong>Octoboom Dive</strong> or <strong>Quadroom Dive</strong> with his arms on fire. The method for resolving spread/two-man stack is exactly the same, but with the difference that you now need to stay close to the boss whenever you see fire coming out from his arms. This is still part of the tutorial, so both attacks will be fire as part of the demonstration. From hereon out after you've resolved both attacks, it is now completely random whether the boss will use fire or not. Identify properly whether the boss is on fire or not, and adjust accordingly whenever the boss uses the same attack again throughout the fight.
