Brute Bomber teleports to the middle and chugs down another <strong>Doping Draught</strong>, further increasing the damage he deals. This is followed up by either <strong>Octoboom Bombarian Special</strong> or <strong>Quadroboom Bombarian Special</strong>, which is a series of attacks that will end with either spread or two-man stack, depending on which one the boss uses:
1. Raidwide
2. Raidwide
3. Raidwide
4. Raidwide
5. Raidwide
6. Chariot
7. Donut
8. Knockback which can be anti-knockbacked, do not stay inside the blue circle as thats an instant death.
9. Spread or two-man stacks resolves after a short pause.

The 8th attack is a knockback and the party can approach this two ways. Either you go to your clockspot and you use your anti-knockback, or you go to your partner's intercard to get yourself knocked back without being thrown into the lava pool.

        <th>If you dont want to anti-knockback...</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m3s/bombarian_special_knockback.png' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

Remember whether its <strong>Octoboom Bombarian Special</strong> or <strong>Quadroboom Bombarian Special</strong>, because this will decide whether the final attack is a spread or a two-man stack after the knockback.

    <tr>
        <th>Octoboom Bombarian Special (<Raidwide>spread out!</Raidwide>)</th>
        <th>Quadroboom Bombarian Special</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m3s/octoboom_bombarian_special.png' /><br /><KittenAsset path='m3s/octoboom_bombarian_special.gif' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m3s/quadroboom_bombarian_special.png' /><br /><KittenAsset path='m3s/quadroboom_bombarian_special.gif' /></td>
    </tr>

Keep in mind that the final attack is not a protean, so everyone should keep their distance as the AoE are quite large. In case of <strong>Octoboom Bombarian Special</strong>, the players should immediately spread out and get to their clockspot to avoid the AoE from clipping each other. Otherwise, this mechanic is flashy but nothing special once you count the attacks.
