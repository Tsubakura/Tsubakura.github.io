Brute Bomber teleports to the middle and chugs down another <strong>Doping Draught</strong>, further increasing the damage he deals. This is followed up by either <strong>Octoboom Bombarian Special</strong> or <strong>Quadroboom Bombarian Special</strong>, which is a series of attacks that will end with either spread or two-man stack, depending on which one the boss uses:
1. Raidwide
2. Raidwide
3. Raidwide
4. Raidwide
5. Raidwide
6. Chariot
7. Donut
8. Knockback which can be anti-knockbacked, do not stay inside the blue circle as thats an instant death.
9. Spread or two-man stacks resolves after a short pause.

Keep in mind that the final attack is not a protean, so everyone should keep their distance in case its <strong>Octoboom Bombarian Special</strong> as the AoE are quite large. Otherwise, this mechanic is flashy but nothing special once you count the attacks.
