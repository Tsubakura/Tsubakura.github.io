Be prepared as the Lindwurm will now cast <Raidwide>Idyllic Dream</Raidwide>, which is a strong raidwide that sends you into an alternate dimension. This mechanic lasts for 3.5 minutes, making this the longest savage mechanic you might have encountered in Dawntrail.

<KittenAsset path='m12s/dream_intro.webm' wrapper='div' />

This phase is brutal, as this mechanic is essentially 5-6 mechanics combined into one, not to mention the numerous memory checks in here. If you haven't been doing so, then you are recommended to start using macros in order to keep track of what is happening around you. Here's a checklist of where you can apply macros in this mechanic:
- Was it 十 or X first during staging?
- Apply a mark on yourself, depending on which waymark your clone is.
- Is it north or south safe?
- Who has to swap during towers? Melees or ranged?
- Is it stack or defamation first?
- Which clone got sucked into the portal?
- Which island is safe?

If you do not have set up the macros yet for the self marking, then head over to the [intro](/savage/m12s_p2) to grab them.

## Staging

Just like Replication 2, this mechanic has a <strong>Staging</strong>, a <strong>Replication</strong> and a <strong>Reenactment</strong> phase.

Immediately upon entering this new dimension, the boss will cast <strong>Staging</strong> which will summon a player clone on each clockspot. The set of clones can spawn in either a 十 or an X formation.

<table width='70%'>
    <tr>
        <th>十字</th>
        <th>X</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m12s/dream_staging_plus.png' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m12s/dream_staging_cross.png' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>


**Memory check**: Remember whether it is 十 or X first.
