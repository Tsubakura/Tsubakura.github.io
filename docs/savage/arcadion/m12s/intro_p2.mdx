This is the second phase of M12S. For phase one, head back to [part 1](/savage/m12s_p1) of this fight.

Game8 follows [nukemaru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXxp8nrRw3o), which is a combination of different strategies that were popular during the early weeks:
- [Replication 1](/savage/m12s/replication_1) is done with fixed positions, which is popularly known as [Replication Garou](https://x.com/GarouXIV/status/2010923882585464851) strategy at the EN side.
- [Replication 2](/savage/m12s/replication_2) follows [Ushiko](https://x.com/tsu_chan_pad/status/2009929205291855996).
  - For those who are more familiar with the [banana codex](https://raidplan.io/plan/jaakesbessc2uv7h), the Ushiko is functionally almost the same strategy with some minor differences:
    - B is north instead.
    - The netherwrath is baited near the wall instead.
- [Blood Mana](/savage/m12s/blood_mana) does 1:3, which means the tank takes the north object alone while the non-tanks takes the south object.
- [Idyllic Dream](/savage/m12s/idyllic_dream) follows OneAce of resolving the mechanic.
  - Tuufless has done a writeup of OneAce on his website which also includes the macros that you can use, you can check his website [here](https://xivjpraids.com/7.0_dawntrail/savage_raids/m12s_2/#idyllic-dream-macros).


General notes:
- Just like the first phase, the raidwides in this fight all hit absurdly hard. Expect deaths if your party members are being neglectful with mitigations.
- The <Tankbuster>Double Sobat</Tankbuster> happens three times throughout the fight.
  - Any non-PLD can invuln the first and third tankbuster, while the other can invuln the 2nd one after [Blood Mana](/savage/m12s/blood_mana).
  - Invulning the initial two-man hit is the preferred method in JP PFs, but have a backup plan in case things go awry with the aggro management.
- Check with your PF regarding the burst timings:
  - 0s burst is the most optimal, allowing you to use your final 1m to its full efficiency.
  - Normal burst + send on cooldown is another option, but keep in mind that not all jobs might be able to fully utilize their final 1m.
  - Per suggestion, the most popular burst timing right now in Mana is normal burst + hold 2nd burst until after the kick in [Replication 2](/savage/m12s/replication_2).
    - This option completely forfeits your final 1m window if you are aligning that with the 2m burst, so be careful if your party is going with this option.
