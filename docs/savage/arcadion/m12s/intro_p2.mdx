This is the second phase of M12S. For phase one, head back to [part 1](/savage/m12s_p1) of this fight.

Game8 follows [nukemaru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXxp8nrRw3o), which is a combination of different strategies that were popular during the early weeks:
- [Replication 1](/savage/m12s/replication_1) is done with fixed positions, which is popularly known as [Replication Garou](https://x.com/GarouXIV/status/2010923882585464851) strategy at the EN side.
- [Replication 2](/savage/m12s/replication_2) follows [Ushiko](https://x.com/tsu_chan_pad/status/2009929205291855996).
  - For those who are more familiar with the [banana codex](https://raidplan.io/plan/jaakesbessc2uv7h), the Ushiko is functionally almost the same strategy with some minor differences:
    - B is north instead.
    - The netherwrath is baited near the wall instead.
- [Blood Mana](/savage/m12s/blood_mana) does 1:3, which means the tank takes the north object alone while the non-tanks takes the south object.
- [Idyllic Dream](/savage/m12s/idyllic_dream) follows OneAce of resolving the mechanic.


General notes:
- Just like the first phase, the raidwides in this fight all hit absurdly hard. Expect deaths if your party members are being neglectful with mitigations.
- The <Tankbuster>Double Sabat</Tankbuster> happens three times throughout the fight.
  - Any non-PLD can invuln the first and third tankbuster, while the other can invuln the 2nd one after [Blood Mana](/savage/m12s/blood_mana).
  - Invulning the initial two-man hit is the preferred method in JP PFs, but have a backup plan in case things go awry with the aggro management.
