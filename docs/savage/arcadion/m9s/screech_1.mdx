Similar to the normal mode of this boss fight, Vamp Fatale has buff stacks of satisfaction that will increase throughout the fight. The boss starts with no stacks at first, but will gain one stack every time a player fails a mechanic and will gain four stacks for every time she uses the raidwide <Raidwide>Crowd Kill</Raidwide>.

<img src={satisfied_icon_hr} />

The buff will increase the boss's damage for every four stacks gained. Starting from 8 stacks onwards, the buff will also change the property of some of her attacks, making the mechanics overally harder. Generally, this means that the fight will naturally become harder if the party is performing poorly on mechanics.


## Hardcore

Have both of your tanks enable their stance and pull the boss, because there will be a tankbuster soon that targets the two players with the highest enmity. After a few auto attacks, the boss will cast <Raidwide>Killer Voice</Raidwide>, which is the generic raidwide of this fight. This is immediately followed up by <Tankbuster>Hardcore</Tankbuster>, which is an AoE tankbuster that targets the two player with the highest enmity. If one of the tanks forgot their stance here, then this is where you will probably wipe due to the tankbuster going towards a DPS instead.

Now, the tankbuster by itself is nothing special, but once the boss's satisfaction stacks has reached 8 or more, the size of the AoE will become much larger. This forces both tanks to go all the way to the wall in order to not turn their party members into collateral damage. Remember to keep track of the satisfaction stacks while dealing with this mechanic.

    <tr>
        <th>7 or fewer buff stacks</th>
        <th>8 or more buff stacks</th>
    </tr>

## Vamp Stomp

After resolving the tankbusters, the next recurring mechanic that you will see multiple times throughout the fight is <strong>Vamp Stomp</strong>. Similar to the normal mode version, the arena will be littered with bats that will explode in an AoE once the sonar in the middle touches them. But unlike the normal version, the savage version will inflict a debuff on all players that they have to resolve.

<table width='80%'>
    <tr>
        <th>Debuff</th>
        <th width='90%'>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src={curse_of_the_bombpyre_icon_hr} /></td>
        <td><center><strong>Curse of the Bombpyre</strong></center><br />This debuff will give you the same properties as the bat, which means you will now detonate in a small AoE if the sonar wave touches you. The explosion itself inflicts quite some damage and this is fatal if you accidentally overlap this attack with another player.<br /><br />This debuff will cleanse itself once the AoE has been detonated.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Seeing as each player has now become a living bomb, have everyone split up to their clockspot with melee DPS taking west/east and healers taking southwest/southeast positions. Now, there is a safe and consistent way of doing things, and there are the not so safe methodss of resolving this mechanic which also usually involves in people wanting their uptime for their parse.

More power to the people if they can uptime without causing casualties, but this guide here focuses on safety that allows people to consistently clear.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>1.</td>
        <td>As the boss casts <strong>Vamp Stomp</strong>, get out of the center of the arena and spread out in a clockspot formation. You will see many bats appear in the arena, but as a melee player, the only important ones that you need to look for are the two in the middle.<br /><br />These two bats in the middle always spawn opposite of each other and they will always rotate a quadrant before exploding, meaning that their starting position basically tells you how to dodge their first explosion.</td>
        <td width='40%'><KittenAsset path='m9s/vamp_stomp1.png' /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2.</td>
        <td>Dodge the first set of bat explosions. Keep your distance and use ranged attacks if you have them, because these annoying bats can explode in your face if they happen to spawn cardinally. Once the coast is clear, have the melee entry and <strong>walk</strong> towards the center of the arena.<br /><br />Avoid using any teleport or dash skills, because that will cause you to blow up your party members in the middle instead.<br /><br /><KittenAsset path='m9s/vamp_stomp_melee_entry.webm' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m9s/vamp_stomp2.png' /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3.</td>
        <td>As for the ranged players in each corner, dodge the 2nd set of bat explosions first by using your eyes to see whether you have to dodge left or right. Once the explosion has been dodged, you can safely enter the sonar and resolve your bomb debuff. <br /><br />The third set of bats can be completely ignored once you've reached the center of the arena.<br /><br /> <KittenAsset path='m9s/vamp_stomp_ranged_entry.webm' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m9s/vamp_stomp3.png' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

Once you've gotten out of the onslaught of bats, whether by playing safe or through PvPing your party members, Vamp Fatale will finish this up with <strong>Brutal Rain</strong>, which is a multi-hit stack marker that hits more times as the boss gets more satisfaction stacks. Heal and mitigate as necessary, and whoever gets the stack marker should run near the boss to allow melee players to keep their uptime.

For more references as to how to deal with the bats, here are some more examples as reference:

        <td><KittenAsset path='m9s/vamp_stomp_example2.webm' /></td>

## Sadistic Screech

Vamp Fatale will cast <Raidwide>Sadistic Screech</Raidwide>, which signals the start of the first major mechanic. This cast itself is a strong raidwide, so heal up and mitigate as necessary. Once the boss finishes casting, the party will be transported into a smaller arena in where you now come face to face with a giant grinder called the Coffinmaker.

<KittenAsset path='m9s/coffinmaker_intro.webm' wrapper='div' />

In this mini phase, your goal as a party is to destroy that grinder before that thing kills you. Similar to normal mode, the grinder will slowly move one square tile at a time until your party has no more space left to dodge the blades. The difference however in savage, is that both the Coffinmaker and Vamp Fatale will attack you at the same time in order to make it harder for your party.

Vamp Fatale will use <strong>Half Moon</strong> to do alternating halfroom cleaves, which will either force you to go front-to-back, or back-to-front. The Coffinmaker on the other hand, will use <strong>Coffinfiller</strong> to fire its blades forward in pairs, with the order of it firing being revealed by the saws lighting up when the cast is about to happen. 

After each attack, the Coffinmaker will march forward by using <strong>Dead Wake</strong> in order to push your party back. Getting hit by this attack is an instant death, so under no circumstances should you be under its blades when it is marching forward.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m9s/coffinfiller1.webm' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m9s/coffinfiller2.webm' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

Once the boss has pushed you all the way to the back, Vamp Fatale will change her position and do left-to-right or right-to-left cleaves instead.

<KittenAsset path='m9s/coffinfiller3.webm' wrapper='div' />

If at this point the Coffinmaker is still not destroyed yet after the boss has done two sets of attacks, then the Coffinmaker will do a final <strong>Dead Wake</strong> to commit mass murder, wiping your party on the spot.

There are no tricks here. Once you've recognized the patterns of this mechanic, this mini phase boils down to having good execution of mechanics while doing as much DPS as you can in order to get through this phase. Don't get hit and play safely if you're not confident in your ability to greed, and you should be having no issue in getting through this phase.

<KittenAsset path='m9s/coffinmaker_full.webm' wrapper='div' />

Upon destroying the Coffinmaker, Vamp Fatale will end this phase with another <Raidwide>Sadistic Screech</Raidwide> in order to send your party back to the original arena.
