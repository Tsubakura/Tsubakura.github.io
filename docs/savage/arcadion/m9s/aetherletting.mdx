Slowly drag the boss back to the center in order for their melee to keep their uptime, as the boss will soon teleport back to the middle. As she teleports back to the middle, she will now cast the first instance of <Raidwide>Crowd Kill</Raidwide>, which will grant her four stacks of satisfaction buffs.

As a reminder if your party is doing very poorly on mechanics, her attacks will deal more damage as she gets more buff stacks and some of her attack patterns will change once the stacks reach 8.

After her <Raidwide>Crowd Kill</Raidwide>, the boss will use <Raidwide>Finale Fatale</Raidwide> to shrink the arena into a circle, which is the cue for her next major mechanic. Dark AoE puddles will spawn around the arena, so dodge accordingly.

## Aetherletting

Vamp Fatale will fire eight cones of AoE that covers the whole arena like a pizza, which needs to be dodged. At the same time, one random support and one random DPS, up to four times so that each player gets a turn, will be targeted with an AoE. This AoE will set a bomb on the floor which will randomly explode in either an X or a 十 shape.

This mechanic looks hard to resolve on the first glance due to the random nature of the explosions while the boss is attacking you with cones, but fortunately, the JP players found out that the middle of the arena is always safe as long as the explosions are dropped in very specific spots near the wall, giving birth to the braindead strategy that is now adopted in PF.

## Braindead Aetherletting

This mechanic is free as long as nobody eats a cone AoE to the face or fails to drop their bomb at their waymark spot.

Each waymark has a player designated to it, which is the spot where the players drop their AoE on. Once you see the red marker on top of your head, you will have exactly 5 seconds to run to your waymark in order to drop off the bomb. The placement does not require precision, as long as the AoE is dropped inside the waymark.

To dodge the cone, remember the first slice and the direction it rotates, then dodge into the safe spot once the cone has gone off.

Make your way back to the middle of the arena after you have planted the bomb on the waymark, and let the bombs resolve itself. Once all bombs are resolved, the boss will use <Tankbuster>Hardcore</Tankbuster>, <strong>Vamp Stomp</strong>, <strong>Half Moon</strong> and the multi-hit stack <strong>Brutal Rain</strong> in that order to attack your party. These are all attacks you've seen before, so use your mitigations and deal with them accordingly.

## Half Moon

Just like <Tankbuster>Hardcore</Tankbuster>, the property of <strong>Half Moon</strong> will change depending on how many satisfaction stacks the boss has. Chances are, you might have experienced this already during the Coffinmaker phase while you were freshly progging.

If you don't want to bother with checking the buff stacks, then you can treat all cleaves as if its a big cleave to consistently dodge it every time.

        <th>7 or fewer buff stacks</th>
        <th>8 or more buff stacks</th>
