Vamp Fatale is notably frustrated as she can't dominate your party no matter what, which initiates her to use her <Raidwide>Crowd Kill</Raidwide> for the second time. This will push her satisfaction buff stacks up to at least 8, no matter how well your party has performed in the earlier phases. On the bright side, if your party has been performing very poorly, then the buff stacks will never exceed 16.

After the <Raidwide>Crowd Kill</Raidwide>, the boss will use <Raidwide>Finale Fatale</Raidwide> to turn the arena into a circle again. 

## Hell in a Cell

In this mechanic, four towers will spawn in each clockspot that needs to be soaked by a player. Upon soaking the tower, the player will be locked up in a cell and in order to escape, they have to destroy the cell from within by attacking it. The cell is immune to all outside damage, so each player needs to use their own strength to escape.

Meanwhile, the four players who did not get jailed will be attacked by the boss with either <strong>Ultrasonic Amp</strong> or <strong>Ultrasonic Spread</strong>, which will alternate depending on which one the boss uses first.  <strong>Ultrasonic Amp</strong> is a 4-man stack protean that targets the healer, while <strong>Ultrasonic Spread</strong> will attack each role with a protean, with the protean aimed at the tank being a <Tankbuster>Ultrasonic Spread</Tankbuster> tankbuster.

Hitting any of the jailed people with the proteans will cause instant death to them, so the outside group's responsibility is to resolve them without the proteans hitting the jailed group.

## Setup

The <strong>Hell in a Cell</strong> happens twice, so assign the MT light party as the first one to take the towers, while the ST light party takes care of the 2nd set. In order to prevent multiple people from going into the same tower by accident, the PF uses a snake prio from north, using the following role priority: T > M > R > H

Here are some examples how the towers are assigned using the above priority system.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Example 1</th>
        <th>Example 2</th>
        <th>Example 3</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m9s/hell_in_a_cell_tower_setup_example1.png' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m9s/hell_in_a_cell_tower_setup_example2.png' /></td>
        <td><KittenAsset path='m9s/hell_in_a_cell_tower_setup_example3.png' /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

Now, you might have noticed in the examples how the other light party is prepositioned in the area where there is two waymarks worth of space available. This is intentional, because they need to resolve the protean cones without the attacks hitting the jailed people.

The <Tankbuster>Ultrasonic Spread</Tankbuster> on the tank and <strong>Ultrasonic Amp</strong> are wide cones, so these attacks can only be resolved in the big gap in order to not hit any of the jailed people. The spread for the DPS and Healer can be resolved on the smaller gaps due to the attack being smaller, but they need to be split up as DPS and Healers cannot overlap on the same spot.

If its <strong>Ultrasonic Amp</strong>, then have everyone stack on where the tank is. Now, if its <strong>Ultrasonic Spread</strong> instead, then the DPS and Healer needs to move out to other open spaces. This is done using TDH snake priority by using the wide open space, which is the tank spot, as the new north.

With the setup completed, you should now have all the information needed to resolve this mechanic properly. Just remember that as a tank, the <Tankbuster>Ultrasonic Spread</Tankbuster> will one shot you if you do not use your personal mitigations on it.
