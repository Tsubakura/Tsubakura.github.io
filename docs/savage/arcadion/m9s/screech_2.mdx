After dealing with the barrage of earlier attacks, Vamp Fatale will use <Raidwide>Insatiable Thirst</Raidwide> to restore the arena back to how it was. But wait! Immediately after, she will use <Raidwide>Sadistic Screech</Raidwide> for the 2nd time in this fight. You may have destroyed her Coffinmaker last time, but Vamp Fatale has plenty of other weapons in her arsenal that can make your party submit to her.

## Sadistic Screech

Upon entering this new arena, you will see two giant saws and two smaller saws. The two giant saws will saw left/right in a fixed horizontal position, while the smaller saws will patrol throughout the arena using a fixed route. Getting hit by these saws is not instantly fatal, but it will inflict a bleed that will inevitably kill you without some help from the healers.

While the saws are flying around you, the boss will summon two tankbuster towers, one at each north/south halves of the arena, and one electric pylon in a random tile. The tankbuster towers are not lethal to tanks even without mitigations, so using any single mitigation is sufficient if you want to cut down on the necessary healing required from the healers.

Similar to the normal mode, the tankbuster towers will drop a spiked ball (Fatal Flail) that needs to be destroyed before it blows up. The new addition to this fight in savage are the electric pylons (Deadly Doornail) that are dropped on the stage, which creates a denial of area effect that slowly expands over time. Although the electric pylons area of denial are not instantly fatal, they once again inflict a lethal bleed that will kill you without a healer babysitting you.

Because the spiked balls are always dropped on one half each, which is north and south, have the MT/D1 be responsible for the north half, while the ST group takes care of the south half. The ranged players are all responsible for focusing fire on the electric pylon, because the area of denial makes it too hazardous for melees to destroy them.

The melees should be focusing on the spiked balls, while the ranged focuses on the pylon. Once the spiked balls are down, the melee should help the ranged group in taking down the pylon if possible. Unless you can place your confidence in your party, you do not attack the boss until all the adds on the field are destroyed. Jobs like GNB and VPR are strong here, because their bursts are AOE by default, which can cleave multiple targets if the adds are grouped together in the center.

The two tankbuster towers and the electric pylon will arrive in waves of three. During the first and second wave, the boss will also immediately follow this up with a <Raidwide>Killer Voice</Raidwide>, which is a strong raidwide that must be mitigated. After the third wave, the boss will do a long pause before she casts <Raidwide>Sadistic Screech</Raidwide>, which will end this mini phase. If there are pylons still alive at this point, then the pylons will explode and deal lethal damage to your party, very likely wiping your party on the spot.

The main importance in this phase is that players should minimize the damage taken by **not** running into the saws. The saws routing are fixed, so dodging the small saws is a matter of alternating between outside and inside columns. Accident do happen and a good healer can still salvage the situation if things go awry, but otherwise, this phase isn't too bad.
