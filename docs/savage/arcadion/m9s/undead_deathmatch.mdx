Vamp Fatale will create two towers, each which needs to be soaked by four players, which will chain the players to a bat once the tower resolves. The players cannot stretch the chain too far, as doing so will cause the player to take heavy damage until that person dies. Each bat will always chain four players, so if any of the towers has 3 or fewer players on it, then the bat will chain a random person in the other tower and very likely kill off that person.

The tower will randomly either spawn north/south or west/east, so have MT group take north/west, while ST group takes south/east.

## Undead Deathmatch

The mechanic is fairly straightforward: The bat you're chained to will either randomly rotate clockwise or counterclockwise, which forces you to follow the bat in order for your chain to not get stretched. At the same time, the boss in the middle will use <strong>Sanguine Scratch</strong> to fire off cones that will alternate between safe spots.

Once the bats have made a 180 degrees circle, they will randomly either use a chariot or a donut, which is signaled by the icon above their heads. If its a chariot, then stay around the boss circle. If its a donut instead, then simply go under the bat to dodge the attack.

Just like many of the other mechanics in this fight, there are no tricks here. Your survival largely depends on how well you are in executing the movements without tunnelvisioning in your DPS rotation. To ensure that you do not lag too far behind, you must be able to dodge two cones ahead while moving as doing one cone dodges will not be sufficient enough to keep up with the bat.

## Enrage sequence

From hereon, everything you see will be repeat mechanics. After finishing two sets of chasing the bats, the boss will use <strong>Brutal Rain</strong>, <strong>Vamp Stomp</strong>, <strong>Half Moon</strong> and <Tankbuster>Hardcore</Tankbuster> in that order. After dealing with all that, the boss will use <strong>Sanguine Scratch</strong>, which is easier than the last mechanic because you do not need to worry about the bats this time.

If the boss is not yet defeated at this point, then the boss will first use <Raidwide>Insatiable Thirst</Raidwide> to turn the arena back to normal. This is then followed up by the final <Raidwide>Crowd Kill</Raidwide>, which effectively maxes out her satisfaction stacks. If she is still not yet defeated at this point, then Vamp Fatale will now cast <Enrage>Finale Fatale</Enrage>, which will effectively wipe the raid if she gets this cast successfully off.
